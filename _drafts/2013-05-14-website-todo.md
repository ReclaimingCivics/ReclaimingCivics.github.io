### Build information and person

1. Links to all public profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow)
2. Get a professional picture
3. Get a gravatar (pencil sketch?)
4. Get posts on front page. Get introduction clipped and factored out

### Make easier on me

1.  Can you get me.echl.in -> echl.in/me?
2.  You have begun code duplication; specifically the archives and categories page. This can be done in Jekyll. What you do is you factor out an include layer of those pages (somehow).
3.  Those header links at the top of the page should be local. Again, this is doable in Jekyll. They will take a prefix variable before being insert.

### Bells and whistles

1. Plug in Olark
2. Figure out how the heck comments work 
3. Begin using Google Analytics. Note this is going to be part of getting readership.
4. Customize CSS in some meaningful way
5. Functional RSS feed, ideally split by category
10. Get rid of the annoying categories @ bottom of post

### Completed

1. Functional email
2. Private / public post separation
