title: How can a brilliant programmer write code for the rest of us?
layout: post

In my career I've had the experience of working directly with one of the most brilliant programmers I have met thus far. He has the kind of fluency in software that everyone envies: enough years and diversity of experience across a variety of languages, frameworks, technologies, tools, and products, and obvious "spark"-like intelligence so that any new idea or technology encountered is immediately obvious and fits in with the consortium of knowledge acquired already.

Working directly downstream of this colleague was one of the greatest privileges I have had as a developer. I was largely expected to know a lot of things that I didn't. For instance, after a few months of expecting to be strong in concurrent programming in Java, and doing what I could for myself by engaging in Q&A-ing on StackOverflow on the topic and learning *Concurrency in Java*, I found myself actually quite strong in concurrent programming in Java.

But, and what I want to focus on more in the post, it was also very tantalizing and disconcerting, because I felt stupid, a lot, and a lot of times I felt the kind of stupid that detracts from one's esteem and focus and ability. There were points that I did a lot of asking myself, "Maybe I'm simply not *smart* enough to be good at Node.js development," and when a thought like this hits when I'm generally short on mental resources, it's been a little too easy to believe. It took a while for me to be able to say, "Wait a minute, the last thing I seriously intellectually struggled with was algebraic geometry. You know, scheme theory," and, the difficulty of the concepts at hand, clearly, pale in comparison.
