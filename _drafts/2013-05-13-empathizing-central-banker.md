Ezra Klein has been raving about his economist colleague Neil Irwin's book *The Alchemists,* which is an account of the actions taken by the three most important central bank leaders to stabilize the global economy during the crisis.

It's a hard book to write. Firstly it's obviously very political content. Irwin's overall stance strikes me as clear: referring to the bankers as "The Alchemists" certainly connotes respect. Secondly Irwin has a lot of difficult economics and a lot of history he must research and distill and create and share with his readers. And biography. Perceiving and articulating ("making up") what a historical figure - in this case, most prominently, three livings ones - is feeling is impossible to do objectively.

The bankers are painted as being the obvious answer to the riddle of whether an individual can influence the course of history. The answer is, emphatically, yes. Which means if we want to understand our economy, we actually need to understand a lot about these three very important men.

- Okay Dan, this is a tough one.  You have very good insight but this is going to take actual work to craft.  Try outlining.

* Your thesis is that since they crafted history, biographical instrumentation is the proper device by which to understand monetary policy.
* Talk about how fascinatingly human they are.
* You also want to talk about how reading this has helped you factor the world into problems you can become a central banker over.  Where your habits and ideals are going to propagate into very real impact.
