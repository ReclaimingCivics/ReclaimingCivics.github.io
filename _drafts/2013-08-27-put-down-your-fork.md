In Omnivore's Dilemma, author Michael Pollan discusses a scene in which he orders a decadent steak and begins reading Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. He indulged in the irony, and more precisely, indulged in the experiment: could he actually eat this steak while having these ideas dance through his mind?

"And that's when I put down my fork," writes Pollan, a couple pages later of reading impeccable arguments in favor of vegetarianism.

Something truly fascinating happens in that moment. The closest we come to appreciating it is in confronting the question, is this a dream? Is this *The Matrix*? But it doesn't happen terribly often that while reading the most suspenseful point in a mystery novel, we actually expect the murderer to burst through the door and threaten us. So why can it happen while reading *Animal Liberation*? What is it about the ideas in that book that let them jump through your brain in the form of deductions and ideas, then read your hand and instruct you to put down your fork? And conversely, if that can happen once ever, why doesn't it always happen?

I'm reminded of The Big Five personality test, which like every personality test claims to have found some axes by which to measure a personality that bears some vague consistency and usefulness. One axis is Neuroticism, which measures how a person tends to react to negative information. And, as far as that trait is concerned, I would say Pollan was reacting "neurotically" (in the language of the Big Five) in that moment. The negative information in the book he was reading suddenly became real, and real enough to have a real impact on the food Pollan was consuming. Things don't get much more real than the food you are consuming.

Fortunately, in modern American culture, veganism is not a negative. It's not an act of starvation because one does not know how to cope with what's going on in a factory. Besides animal liberation, many vegans find a lot of freedom in owning their food chain in a particular way that they have never experienced before. I don't have to think of how a car works and I don't really have to think of how a computer works. Maybe it would be a bit better for me or society to understand these things a little bit better, but surely food seems like a somehow special thing to understand not just as an abstract supply chain with ethical and environmental implications happening in stories and dense books by investigative journalists only in our theoretical curiosities, but as the nutrition one is going to consist of going forward.
