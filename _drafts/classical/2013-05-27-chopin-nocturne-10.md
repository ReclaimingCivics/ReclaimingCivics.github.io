I like [this recording](http://grooveshark.com/s/Nocturne+No+10+In+Ab+Major/2Vi75v?src=5). The word that consistently comes to mind in listening to it is "plot." This piece is plot.

It's an extraordinarily wonderful piece to be playing on my mind, because it then narrates whatever other thoughts I experience. Anxious or depressive brooding? It's easy to see that as part of process, as moving in a direction. And the Nocturne is A-B-A form. A sweet section, a buildup and a darkness, and a triumphant return. Having this piece as a thread on one's mind makes it easier to perceive process in *anything*, whether it's during a meditation (since songs tend to surface), while coding and getting stuck, or when thinking about life and hoping one is still growing.
