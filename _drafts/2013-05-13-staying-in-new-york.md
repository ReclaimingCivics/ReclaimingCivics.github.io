title: Why I Am Staying In New York
---

The question of whether to stay in New York or to move is, for me, as well as for many other people, a thorny one.  Something about the combined infinite potential of a world elsewhere together with putting the past several years' life experience on the table and saying "Was this good or *worth* it?" is just too much to fit in a pro/con list or even attempt to be rational about.

I don't think I realized the truth of this until I saw it put in juxtaposition with just the right things:

The point of this post isn't to write my own memoir how impossible decisions are, especially when they get philosophical. But, I have come up with some surprisingly firm observations and opinions to make a decision from.  And *those* are worth sharing.

Largely, it comes down to a simple theme: people try to and have to make sense of things, including their own life. The challenge isn't not to idealize our lives or ourselves, but to do it well and with health. The psychoanalyst Karen Horney, who has very profound things to say on the topic of personal development, referred to "the tyranny of the should" and the "idealized self."  I'm not sure if I've read Horney wrong or too simplistically or rather I just disagree with her, but I emphatically say *should's are important.* Shoulds get us through things like rough patches in our careers: If I'm this unfocused at work does it mean I'm bad at this job? If I don't love my job should I try to change it? Should I quit and do what I'm *really* passionate about? Many people I have known (note I am not generalizing to "all people," that would be completely missing the point of this paragraph!) who have an active source of misery in their lives begin looking for semblances of what is normal and expected to go through, and try to identify visions of their lives that fit in with a narrative.

We need narratives on early dates and interviews. We need narratives when convincing next partner why the last relationship really is over. We need narratives when interviewing for a job, so we can explain why the last one didn't work out but this one will. But we don't just need these narratives for partners and employers: *we need them for ourselves.* So that when we think of calling our ex when the fundamentals of why the relationship didn't work out haven't changed, we have something to say. Or so that we know what job to look for after being fired and not setting ourselves up for the same mistake. Narratives are how we factor the mistakes and misfortunes of the past as something that happened for our growth from our hope for the future, and how we build agency over it in our present. I would venture to say avoiding the "tyranny of the should" just means becoming psychologically stronger at finding expedient narratives for our immediate actions and long-term growth rather than discontinuing the cognitive practice entirely.


1.  I was able to filter out a lot of noise on the topic by the fact that I was able to identify a huge chunk of the voice of "New York is awful! Get somewhere else!" as coming from people who idolize San Francisco and bash me for idolizing New York.

2.  New York does pretty well in sunlight days. Definitely compared to Chicago or Seattle.

3.  I feel more constrained socially by my distance to people I like spending time with than "my inability to meet people." This is something I genuinely think might be easier in a smaller city.

4.  Car-independence is *really* important to me.

5.  New York has a *very* diverse white-collar economy and a *huge* tech sector. Second only to SF, I believe. It wasn't obvious for me to realize a lot of people bemoaning the corporate culture...  don't actually know either of these things.

1.  The career jabs come from people who think of New York as finance finance finance.  I've never heard them from people who have actually worked in New York. There are hundreds if not thousands of compelling startups here. Is that enough? If my job were to be employed at a startup and I were to invest 40 hours a week into searching, I fully claim that I would be limited by my research and networking abilities far more than the availability of potential connections.
