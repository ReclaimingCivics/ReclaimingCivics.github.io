* Why do I want to make more money in the near-term?
* What are the next home-improvement-like expansions I want to make to my own life?

Yes, it's good to think of these things.

* It keeps me focused on my actually pretty important goal of making money. Even if increased consumption isn't my ultimate goal, it's completely just to harness it as motivation
* It's better to keep my consumption curve mindful than erratic. If I make a literall small fortune, I would like to be able to answer the question, "Is this how I saw myself spending it?"

Title is because it's reminiscent of the constant improvement I see my parents go through. It really is an end-goal in life in a way I can't empathize with, but perhaps I can via analogizing.

## Increased Consumption Goals

### Dream Apartment

1.  In Brooklyn. I have really enjoyed living in Brooklyn and would like to not forget this and chuck it all for Manhattan when chance comes. Here's why:
    - I can reasonably imagine myself making enough to have a very nice apartment in Brooklyn, without having to become very competitive or wasteful with my spending.
    - Much lower chance of dealing with an insane landlord
    - I think I can get the space to have my own get-togethers
    - There might be more early-stage startup scene in Brooklyn, which may be my next career goal. Actually it probably is
    - I've seemed to do a somewhat better job of making friends in Brooklyn. Linda, Jared, Jennifer, Mitha, BPL Hackathon all had some boost come from the Brooklyn-ness. Arguably Emily even.

2. Corgi. Corgi is kind of my American Dream. Must be able to support corgi.

3. I want to have my own get-togethers.

4. It should be nice, you know?

### Career Freedom

* I have somewhat of a vision of a career that is between business and technology layer. I'm not quite strong enough in technology to be a startup beast (although I'm not far from this), and not quite strong enough in business or network to incubate my own ideas (although I'm not far from this either). I think there's an ideal career for me that is some sort of "balance," but it will take freedom to carve it out.
* Obviously, want to write more.
* I should put real time and effort into learning data, math, that stuff.

### Travel

* I wrote this up in a travel wishlist of sorts. It would be nice to remember that Japan is somewhat of a dream of mine. That dream has been dormant for a while, obviously.
* I would completely love to be able to just spend a couple months with my parents. At home.

### Public service investments

* At some point I have a few donations I need to make. And I want to start thinking young about how I will make sure some of my salary is devoted to charity.

### I don't want to spend a lot of money on

* Fashion. I'm thinking about this still. Certainly some more, but I think there's a more frugal style or identity I can carve for myself that will fit better with both my values and "brand."
* Apartment shouldn't be decadent, I suppose. I think my Brooklyn requirements capture this.
* I've already quit drinking mostly and need to stay that way.
* I don't want a big dog in the city.
