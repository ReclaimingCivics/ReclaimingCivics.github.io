This book was good for a few reasons.

One, it's very positive. Very much a belief-in-people book. People usually means engineers in this case, but the author develops a pride in oneself, in society, in the profession. I particularly liked the short discussion of engineers in society and am glad that was considered in scope.

####In carrying out a project, do not wait passively for anyone - suppliers, sales people, colleagues, supervisors - to make good on their delivery promises; go after them and keep relentlessly after them.

This is specific but eye-opening. The essence of "get stuff done" is seeing how this works. Other aspects of get-stuff-done, like risk-monitoring, are the same mentality as this. If you're not controlling your project, then your project is out of control.

#### Develop a "let's go see!" attitude.

I starred this since I spit out estimates before poking around too much.

#### Strive for conciseness and clarity in oral or written reports.

I'm bad at this. Key sentences:

> It is so difficult to get a direct answer out of some engineers that their usefulness is thereby greatly diminished. The tendency is to explain the answer before answering the question. ... The important thing is to state the essence of the matter as succinctly as possible first.

#### Be extremely careful of the accuracy of your statements.

I need to stop giving estimates of issues I was just introduced to. I do not stand my ground enough on "I don't know." I don't defend against "I don't see how this could take long." I sure as heck don't either because I just heard of it, of course I don't see much of anything about it.

#### Cultivate the habit of "boiling matters down" to their simplest terms.

Particularly blatant in meetings, which dawdle until someone wants to go and says "okay so the problem is this." Why not do that from the get-go?

#### Cultivate the habit of making brisk, clean-cut decisions.

The startling thing here is this claim:

> The application of judgment can be facilitated by formulating it into principles, policies and precepts in advance.

Really?

#### One of the most valuable personal traits is the ability to get along with all kinds of people.

Ah yes, the quality I have when I'm doing well, and have none of when I'm doing poorly. Key points here:

1. Cultivate the tendency to appreciate the good qualities, rather than the shortocmings of each individual. [Beautifully specific.]
2. Don't be the easily annoyed type.
3. Make it a rule to help the other person whenever an opportunity arises. [Key word: whenever.]
4. Do not take yourself or your work too seriously. [See (2).]
5. Put yourself out just a little to be genuinely cordial in greeting people.

#### Never underestimate the extent of your professional responsibilty and personal liability.

There is a culture in engineering of having a duty to society. This culture is not strictly in the bounds of economic rationality. Which is amazing, so, embrace it.

#### Refrain from using profanity in the workplace.

I know this completely well, but sometimes I get the idea it's fun anyway. But there is a beautiful sentence: "The trouble in using profanity is that its actual effect is known only to the listener." That's true.

#### Take it upon yourself to learn what constitutes harassment and discrimination - racial, ethnic, sexual, religious - and tolerate it not at all in yourself, your colleagues, your subordinates, or your company.

I joke about race issues too freely. It's probably from watching 30 Rock. I forget that it's off-color because for me it's part of developing awareness, and probably when I'm more socially in tune I do this safely and in right company and empathically, but when less socially in tune probably at high risk. So I need to stop like I need to stop using profanity.
