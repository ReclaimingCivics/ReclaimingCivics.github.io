Dan, write up the following:

* placebos are good for you study
* getting in touch with nutrition's impact. You had junk food and noticed your mind racing more on the way home. Harder to focus on things. That relief you felt that let you eat junk food was the same relief that made it harder to focus on what is good for you.
* probably want to write about how eastern stuff beats western stuff here
* what if other self-fulfilling prophecies don't work?
