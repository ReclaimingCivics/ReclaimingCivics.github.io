I read this quote over from Farnam Street Blog, by Charles Munger:

> “It is in the nature of things,” says Charlie Munger, “that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward.”

This piqued me. Fortunately Munger says it correctly. He says "many", not "most." It still irks me though.

What is the general space of hard problems being assumed here? This happens terribly often in short quotes in general, and also in a lot of nonfiction writing. My attempt to rectify:

" In my experience, it tends to happen, that if one feels difficulty in a problem that has persisted for several days, one ought to try addressing it backward and see if that works."

This is now a more literal claim. It's almost one that can be tested in a lab, since we can have some concurrence over what a problem is.

I'm fascinated to no end by the generic sheathing of "wisdom" that seems to infect the genre of quotes and apply only when it's impossible to intelligibly think in this generality. However, I'm also fascinated by turning general claims into specific, usable ones, and see if they sound reasonable.
