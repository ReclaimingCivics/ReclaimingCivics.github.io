title: Is Wikipedia credible?
category: general

This question came up a few days ago.  So naturally I googled it; I can't remember the exact phrase, but

* the second link was, well, [Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReliability_of_Wikipedia&ei=I62OUfH1Ovew4APIiYDgBw&usg=AFQjCNFICHIgL1iI-6r7JaAUuFv0V1Sr0Q&sig2=PexzYTBpXc8SUjAli2LTNw&bvm=bv.46340616,d.dmg)
* The third link was [from Harvard's College Writing Program](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&pageid=icb.page346376)

Which do you think I clicked as likely to have better information?  Wikipedia or something out of a Harvard site?  Wikipedia, of course.

Anyway, I think "Is Wikipedia reliable?" is a broken question that we all need to immediately stop asking.  The reliability of information is *not* an absolute question.  It depends on what you are using the information for, and in general, one should be in the habit of coloring one's language with qualifiers stating why something is true.
