1)  What is your strategy for getting rid of estates?
2)  What is your strategy for getting rid of copper?
3)  Are there cards that you win if you have more of especially early?  Grand Market, Minion, Hunting Party, Caravan, Nobles.
3)  Are there accelerator cards - stables is stronger than laboratory, then spice merchant, etc. - to help you cycle through your strong attack or engine cards?
4)  Are there "engine" cards like minion, laboratory, hunting party, governor?  What resources do these cards need to run optimally?  e.g. - Minion needs density.  Hunting Party needs just enough $$ that it can reach.
5)  Are there actions?
6)  Are there buys?  Is your engine useful if there aren't buys?
