#Chapter 3

The paradigm of economics is that all economics is really barter, and money is a fixed commodity in which other commodities are measured, more for convenience, that is, so you can do math.  But if we don't look at what you can do math on and look at the history, we realize barter is not a priori.

Credit theory:  Money is not a commodity, but an abstraction of credit, a measurement, an accounting tool.  More imaginary.  And this has more evidence of being an accurate model of the origins of money in that credit precedes coinage historically.  Credit becomes currency when credit becomes iteratively transferable - and the IOUs are large in number, larger than a few people giving an IOU can create.  Interestingly, you can circulate an "I am owed" and an "IOU", but the IOU is much more transferable.  This seems like it's in the negative, but it's in the negative because you transfer outward, not bring inward.  Redeeming an "I am owed" means paying back debt.

Chartalism - fiat currencies come from taxation, not from mutual trust.

If you pay back debt, you can no longer circulate it.  Paying back debt is reducing the money supply.

Create consumer demand - don't tax back all of the currency and it continues to circulate as currency.  Each time currency circulates it means somebody wanted something and creates demand, and they'll want it again...

Adam Smith:  The market can regulate itself if the government fixes the money supply.

Chartalism as history's weakness:  by what right does the state collect taxes, assuming it's not pure thuggary?  This is patched by primordial debt theory, where debt = original sin, and this is where the author gets anthropological.  One theory is the basis for money is legal:  If you really do owe somebody something, perhaps because you damaged it, you need to measure it in terms of something that it can be repaid in.  Not barter at all, prescription of things rarely bartered even.

Primordial debt weakness:  1) how do you repay a god?  2) free citizens don't pay taxes.  In fact rulers usually interfere by canceling private debts.  Private ones happened (I guess) because in Mesopotamia you had a ton of produce and grain and wool and not much of anything else, and had to trade, unevenly.

Author:  maybe the point of "repaying debt to society" is to rid of the arrogance that you're separate of it.  You were born, and separated of your ego, now return to it by repaying your debt.  Economic byproduct:  take out a loan, now make surplus!  knowledge, children, whatever.

Social debt - Comte in French Revolution.  I (me personally) have money that I don't deserve, that makes it a debt to society.  Because I got it by borrowing it and my IOUs are off somewhere else.

Leads to a false dichotomy:  free market where you start with nothing and trade to get everything, state where you start in the hole and have to repay everything just to get even.  This simple viewpoint fractures all the way down to Congress and economic policy.

#Chapter 4

Money is between a commodity and a debt token.  Currencies vary from super-local, personal IOUs that there is trust are redeemable (i.e. won't default), to global, meaning they had to be precious metals so they would be acceptable internationally and strategically hover the IOU/commodity line.

Nietzsche sees deal making as fundamental to being human.  However starting from Adam Smith's barter he wound up at the indebtedness to the tribe and society from which one receives so much -- and therefore Smith -> primordial debt theory.  This culminates in the ancestors becoming more and more important and powerful and godlike, until they are the Christian God.

From here it gets interesting because out of love God paid for our sins with Jesus.

Jumps to story of Inuit hunter who despised being thanked for a favor.  By gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.  Refutes Nietzsche, humanity is refusing to calculate debt, not doing so.

(Author) another takeaway from Nietzsche:  debt to guilt to self-torture, yeah that's happened.  Law of Jubilee:  all debts canceled in the 7th year.  And to Jesus' parable about the king who somehow cares about settling debts and the servant who doesn't forgive his.

Ambivalence, paradox in many world religions:  "Reducing human life to a series of transactions is not a very good deal."  Outcries against the market but framed the objection in terms of it.

Liberation from debt is morally more compelling than liberation from a caste system, for some reason.  Problem is loans happen between equals, and line between rich loaner and poor borrower is not precise.  Two parties who ought to be legal equals entering a contract but aren't afterward.  In Old Testament case easy to argue this one pro-debtor since we were all slaves.

#Chapter 5

Whoo boy, this one's long.

Moral basis of debt:  Levi-Strauss proposed social custom is based on reciprocity.  People don't really follow his formula anymore because it's just borne into implicit assumptions.  But there are huge counterexamples anthropologically to reciprocity:  you save a life you take ownership of it, where followers are important for powerful people so have leverage to ask for more to confirm their followdom.

Author outlines three main economics relations foundations:  communism, hierarchy, and exchange.

Communism

Defined as from each according to ability, to each according to need.  All of us are communists most of the time.  E.g., corporations are internally communist, because "need" is kind of defined as "what you need to be productive."  Conversation is baseline communism because a lie can only be a lie if you were expecting the truth.  In helping strangers we always do it if cost is minimal or need is urgent.  Communism != reciprocity - it's not about what the other person will do for you,  but about what they would.  

All societies are baesline communist??

Exchange

It is finite, the relationship is done when the debts cancel.  Unlike communism where eternity is assumed so bookkeeping is dumb.

Constant exchange of imprecisely valued objects among Tiv women, baseline communism but perpetual exchange.

Hierarchy

True charity must be anonymous because it does not imply debt.  If you give money to a panhandler, it's not reciprocal, it's hierarchical, because he'll ask you money again, not give you money.

Hierarchy gives rise to identity.  Firstly the basic idea is that when there is inequality there is not reciprocity, and things usually default to custom.  Must also be a recurring relationship to turn to hierarchy.  Caste and race are extreme, but it's precisely when someone goes above or below that the rules of exchange or communism fall.

Implication:  to engage in exchange is to celebrate equality, i.e., tenet of libertarianism.  In unequals, exchange is nonsensical since gifts are incommensurable.  If priests pray for everyone how many prayers is equivalent to a bushel of wheat?

The three

So why do we always slip into thinking of things in terms of reciprocity or exchange?  Because justice.

Chapter 6

Sex and violence are big deals for pretty much everyone but shoppers at malls - including the very rich (think Strauss-Kahn).
