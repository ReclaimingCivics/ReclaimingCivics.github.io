So you're a developer who just moved to the city. Here are some fragments from my experience that may be useful to you:

* You're going to have a lot of solitary time. For me, this was a surprisingly and serendipitously wonderful change. I remember quite vividly sitting in an East Village coffee shop reading Jane Jacobs' *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*, thinking about my next date with a girl I was seeing. I think the date was pretty relevant, because it means I had six days I didn't have to worry about dating.

I loved this. Shortly after moving to the city I was able to read so many books I would have found compelling but never actually read when I was swamped with coursework. Regardless of your background, it is important to live a healthy and constructive inner life. You will always have down time, and it's good to "hack" it - or better yet, refactor it - into something that you're happy to see happen.

* Get business cards. The design can be very plain if you want. Business cards do three things:
    1.  They give you a gesture on which to end a conversation on a "let's stay in touch" note.
    2.  They serve as a physical reminder for someone to reach out to you, until they act on it.  Until people's inboxes are under control, LinkedIn will not be able to rival this.
    3.  They let you exchange contact information (obviously!) without breaking the flow of interaction.

Seriously, do it right now. You will miss opportunities if you don't have them.

* On that note, remember pretty much anything you do is networking. Networking is not a bad thing. Even all of college is spent networking - and while class probably comes to mind first, I would venture a guess that even more of it happens in dormitories. Networking is an incredibly strong force in college but not a dirty word because it happens with no conscientiousness, whereas in the city and professional realms, to meet people with common interests *and* to build a meaningful relationship going forward each require very conscientious acts. Therefore, networking. Embrace this. Always think (positively!) of how someone can fit in your current life and career visions.

* Learn to use Meetup.
