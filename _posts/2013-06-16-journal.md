#### Goals for week

1.  Consistently wake up early.  Earlier than I need to.  Get back in this habit.  On time for Rick.
2.  Finances are still messed up a little bit. Figure out what to do about money in savings. Hopefully get something out of PS. Pay Rick. 
3.  Do cleanings, I will not stop telling you this.
4.  Spend well. Spend nearly perfectly. No un-pleasures. Get value of not spending on un-pleasures.
5.  Find exercise that works.  Leave time in day devoted to it. Stop making wrong trade-offs.
6.  Cook consistently.

I think your downtime just needs to happen in morning...

#### Start thinking about

3.
