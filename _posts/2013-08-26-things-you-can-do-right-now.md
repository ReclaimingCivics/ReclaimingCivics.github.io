Read this very, very slowly. Slow enough to see yourself wanting to do something and pick it.

### Away from computer

1. Spend some time re-reading EPL. Revisit some chapters you like. Read some you didn't. Slow down. Think.
2. Do cleaning for Sahaj Marg. Practice. Find chances.
3. Continue reading or finish *Omnivore's Dilemma.*
4. Read some magazine articles.
5. Put on a pair of shorts or sweat pants and go for a walk. Pick up a magazine you haven't read before. Sit for a bit and read it. Don't bring journal. Just focus on the walk.
6. Practice piano. Work on drills or scales. Take a break from drills and scales to work on Nocturne. Play something older.
7. Make your apartment cleaner, of course.
8. Flip through Linda's vegan book. Cook something new.
9. Make a trip to Trader Joe's. Not necessarily with any list in mind, just to buy something new and break up your day. But you probably have something you need and can think of. Or just to get a snack.
10. Do something you don't really want to do but you can do. Just think of something and do it. It doesn't matter what. All that matters is that you can do it. Probably running some silly errand.
11. Go get a piece of fruit and eat it.

### Exercise

1. Do stretches.
2. Go for a jog.
3. Go to gym and hop on the treadmill a bit. Take a slow shower and sit in sauna or steam room a bit. Sometimes you like jogging on a treadmill even when you wouldn't like going for a jog outdoors. Remember this.
4. Work on strength or something. Push-ups, stuff like that. See if there's a class at NYSC that would interest you. Hop into it.


### At computer

1. Google a Ruby tutorial. Work on it. (Or Python, Scala).
2. Watch Breaking Bad.
3. Watch 30 Rock or other sitcoms.
4. Start a new TV series. Get through first couple episodes, see if you start to like it.
5. Look at your queue for your job. Scribble it out on paper. Is there anything you can actually work on right now? If so, work on it.
6. Write up the old article on vegetarianism from a while ago. Write something on veganism.
