title: How much risks do I want to take as a rock climber?

Rock climbing is an injurious sport. According to a *Climbers* Magazine poll, 45% of readers suffered an injury in 2014. Tendonitis and popped finger pulleys were most common. A popped pulley costs about 12 weeks of recovery time (Horst, *Training for Climbing*).

Therefore, actively managing recovery is a very important part of rock climbing. Do you have a serious injury or just some soreness? Well, you better guess right. If you don't climb when you should and make a habit of this, you are ruining your training regimen. If you do climb when you shouldn't, you can easily triple your recovery time when you are finally forced to stay off the wall anyway.

The thing is, I think about this every second while climbing. I know crimps pop pulleys, so take them as liltingly as possible. I take falls, but only ones I'm familiar with. I'm spending more time belay climbing, because I believe it is safer than bouldering with its free falls. I have a mathematical brain that is always scanning for these things and finding new ways to avoid risk. I'm very good at not taking risks, and I prefer to avoid mental training and busting through my fear of falling and injury in favor of doubling down on the technical training.

The question I want to explore in this essay is: Is this a good approach? 

I think this is a not-so-simple question. The knee-jerk answer a climber would give is, "hell no." Climbing is about overcoming fear, she would add. But there are many reasons one might be a rock climber, and it's exclusionary to say all of them must involve overcoming a fear of falling.

So let's ask, why do I climb? let's start with an easy one: to be in shape. But that's about conditioning, technique and strength, not about fear. What I can climb at peak performance doesn't matter. In fact, performance itself doesn't matter. The goal of being in shape I can achieve from training and from competing entirely wihtin my comfort zone, and be as fit just the same.

A second reason: because I need a hobby and it feels good to get better at something. But I can get better at technique. in fact, I *am* getting better at technique, and relating moves to their injury risk is definitely a way to improve at technique understanding. 

Another reason: this limits what I can do. but that only makes sense if you think of what I want to do to begin with. Have fun? Check. Get outdoors more? Of course! And fear of rock climbing injury does not stop me from getting outdoors. In fact, it may push me into activities like hiking, or camping, or even sport like map-and-compass, all of which are scary in their own rights, but perhaps a bit more in my comfort zone.

Or, maybe, something like wilderness backpacking would fascinate me because of all the risks that must be managed. Ironically, it may start scarier-sounding, but I may become very good at it. This is a serious point. The most risk-loving climbers certainly cannot complain about having climbers around who know way too much about knot-tying or fending off bears.

In fact, I think it's very fruitful for a climber to develop his own risk personality. Different personalities add color, and different personalities turn to different techniques, areas of expertise, and skill.

And yet, this leaves the question: is this all me? Am I really on track to be an intermediate climber who becomes a great hiker or backpacker, because that's where my comfort zone makes me the strongest?

Climbers, and people in general, believe there is something intrinsically important about overcoming fear in the first place. Honestly, I have to agree, and arguing otherwise just doesn't hold water. To show this, I have to talk about people as emotional-rational, instead of simply rational, beings. Risk aversion does not avert risks. Extreme risk aversion leads to a sedentary lifestyle, which is both deadly in the long term and damages one's chances at happiness in the near term. It's hubristic to try to juggle the chance of a climbing injury in the Gunks while wondering if a foothold is good enough to stand on rationally, but if we invite the advanced machinery of our brain that makes judgments from feelings, we have a chance.

However, some of us weren't born very good at doing that. Feelings are difficult for me. I'm too mathy. If anger and sheepishness and excitement are difficult to experience clearly, how bad do you think fear is? The problem is, without ever feeling that final step of real fear, I never learn what safety is either. Hanging on for dear life is bad technique too, but the most rational, risk-averse of all climbers would never have know.

Climbers are good people, and this is something they understand and the importance of confronting and overcoming fear is part of what makes them better people, both inside and outside of the ER. I have a lot to gain from taking that last step of a fall into the unknown or a road trip to sketchy terrain. And if I do take that step? Well, climbs get more social. We can talk about feelings instead of about the educated risks we are choosing to take or not. We can try to achieve something together and feel excited for accomplishing it, because we really didn't know if we would have the guts.

Why do I climb? Friendship is the one thing I skipped. And what is friendship without overcoming fears together?
