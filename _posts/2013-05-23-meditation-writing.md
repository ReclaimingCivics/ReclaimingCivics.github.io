The little light tan book sitting on my table right now is my meditation journal. It's somewhat difficult choosing a meditation journal, because as the design of everyday things goes, whatever I pick is going to have some non-neutral statement on what a meditation practice is to me.

Being a meditation journal, one would think something unembellished or simpler is the way to go.  But conversely not so much as to make that the *point*. So, anyway, I went with a thicker but smaller journal. Thicker so I can go something of a long time without having to worry about switching it. But, smaller because I know right now it's more important for me to journal a little bit with consistency every day, than it is for me to write long, detailed thoughts on occasion. (Plus, that happens here in this blog.)

It's really important to do this. On the one hand, in any meditation, something good is happening; work is happening. (Skeptics may be, well, skeptical to this, but part of this practice is exercising one's freedom to declare something good or good for oneself. If it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, well, that's the point.) But on the other hand, part of meditation is coming out of meditation mindfully. It's important to finish a meditation with as much mindfulness as it is started, and writing is a pause in which to do that.

We only remember some of what happens in a meditation, but without writing we forget much more. I'll use the example of my own experience over the last few weeks. Most every meditation I would describe as "restful." This is not a bad thing but it's natural to have some disappointment that they would feel so monotonous and adding little tangible value to my day besides keeping me on a regular and rested sleep schedule (okay, so that's pretty major). But in writing just two or three sentences I've added some modifiers.  "Easy" has been one. "I resurfaced halfway but fell back in" is another. And most recently, "I was doing a lot of thinking, I can't remember any of it but I know it was happening."

These are colors to "restful" that I simply would not have known were happening without writing. I would still be under the impression that I was having a very monotonous experience. But now some of the experiences happening in meditation have entered my conscious life more. I am a little more conscious that while resting I'm doing some silent processing of things, and it wouldn't be much surprising for this to free up some mental resources later in the day. But I think it goes deeper than that. This continuity to my meditations that I have been able to *experience* and *perceive* has, literally, augmented my person. More narratives in my life and more rhythms in my mind have entered my consciousness and entered my identity. That is mindfulness.
