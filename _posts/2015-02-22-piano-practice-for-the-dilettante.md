Title: Piano Practice for the Dilettante
layout: post-index
---

I am a dilettante who practices piano sometimes. The problem with being a dilettante who practices piano sometimes is that it's hard to get through hard sections that are integral to the piece. The problem is this is hard. Realistically I can't drill for 20 minutes a day consistently, and if I don't know I'm making progress, I will give up.

I asked <a href="http://music.stackexchange.com/a/29316/10466" target="_blank">StackExchange for advice on overcoming this</a> and got a good one. The following is paraphrased:

* Determining the problem spots is a great start. Practice them! No need to overvalue scales and drills to get through this piece in satisfactory form.
* Practice slowly and accurately. Come back the next day and do it again. Slow, correct practice leads to retention. Cramming does not and leads to a defeatist attitude.
* Just do what you can.
* If you can get the passages engrained in your head, you can practice them on any hard surface. All it takes to do this and get something out of it is a flat surface and memorization.
* Don't undervalue playing the runs in context. It's defeatist to save these to the end.
* Saving the other hand to the end is, however, fine.
