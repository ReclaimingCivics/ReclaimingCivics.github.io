[*New York* reports that Americans read 12 times as many articles about Miley Cyrus than they did about Syria](http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/09/usa-12-times-more-interested-in-miley-than-syria.html) following Miley Cyrus' VMA performance. And all I thought was, yeah, and they probably took more shits than both of those put together and you don't hear any bloggers feeling smugly judgmental over that one.

Apparently it is a *huge* priority among the liberal semi-intelligentsia to get more ordinary Americans to read more "relevant" news. If you follow my writing much, you know I [immensely care about how underrecognized cognitive bandwidth is](https://www.google.com/search?q=cognitive+bandwidth+poverty) as a limiting resource on our decisions and actions.

Suppose you want me, personally, to be better informed on international news. I've made the observation in my personal life that out of a combination of how easy it is to read news and the fact that I feel smugly intelligent when I do, it's my default activity. Not so much reddit or television, but news. In other words, my consumption of news is saturated, and almost certainly to the detriment of other areas of my life.

Furthermore, I tend to do most of my news reading right after work, on RSS. This means my daily routine is as follows: I come home to my lonely apartment, spend an hour or two sitting, then lying down, reading about every depressing topic in the world, then go to bed a few hours later. Depressing news is not followed by social activities or anything fun; it's followed by solitude and sleep. And I wonder why - yeah, you get the point.

So, if you want me to be better informed on foreign policy, this necessarily raises the question: what do you want me to do less of? Should I be less informed on tech news? Read less books? Exercise less?

But this is still too easy. Now imagine I'm someone in the working class, who has to deal with things like car maintenance, credit card debt, kids in general, etc. And apparently, the area of his life you think most warrants immediate improvement is knowledge of Syria?

Reading about Miley Cyrus' night at the VMAs, for instance, might actually be a much better use of time. It's not likely to depress him. It might be entertaining or at least gossip-worthy. And there likely isn't any looming "I should be reading more about this" statement in the background. It probably was really easy. Maybe entertainment news should come out of a person's "effortless entertainment" mental bucket, instead of, well, whatever bucket important news is supposed to fill.

Bluntly, when I hear these comparisons about how Americans read more trashy news than good news, I hear liberal semi-elite ridiculing those whose minds are elsewhere - which we factually know totally includes those in poverty - in an act of total failed empathy. Presumably, these are the same elitists who not long ago knew what's best for poor people a lot of the time, when that was in vogue.

Consuming news is not a free act. It taxes us. It takes our time and mental resources, and probably gets our mind off into topics that are actually likely to, literally, depress us, and away from places it helps us. It is a duty to be a part-time citizen, but it's also a duty to be healthy, know what's in your food, raise kids or maintain a job, and so forth. And I don't think most people feel an ebulliency of free time.

And yes, I do think it's a problem that, for instance, most Americans don't know whether Obamacare is law, a few weeks before its implementation. But I think the caricatures of this problem are lacking empathy and denigrating. If we want to talk about the quality of news consumption in this culture, we should be having a far more intelligent discussion on the topic than we are right now.
