title: Thirty Things I wish I knew before moving to NYC
category: general

I read this post [25 things I wish I knew before moving to SF.](http://jasonevanish.com/2013/01/17/25-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-moving-to-san-francisco/) So I Googled for some NY equivalents. All the ones I found were disappointing. So this is the product of my late morning some Sundays ago:

30 things I wish I knew before moving to NY
---

1. Stop caring about space and start caring about commute. If you hear someone exclaim at how expensive a place is for how small it is, it means they don't live here or don't want to - shorter commute benefits your life FAR more than more square footage.

2. Invest a lot of time and energy into how you're getting your information on what's going on. It's not automatic and there's a real learning curve. Start with basics like Yelp and Meetup. Get magazines like NY Mag or Timeout. If you go to a concert, sign up for the venue's mailing list and the band's mailing list, and try out http://unroll.me/ if you're not privacy-sensitive to keep all those new emails under control. Get a subscription at Club Free Time. Figure out if you like museums, art, classical music, or jazz, and get on mailing lists for as many venues and artists as possible. This is the difference between whether you're cool and enjoy yourself or not.

3. Remember for most things you only need maybe 3 good things to stay happy. One good reliable lunch place that hits your price, nutrition and taste points is far more valuable than a lot of variety that doesn't work for you. 3 good friends to do stuff with and the pressure will be off to be "meeting people." One bar to chill at, one coffee shop, etc. Then exploring is fun and feels optional instead of like a burden.

4. Forget buildings. Pay attention to streets. If you're thinking of living or working in an area, your first impression is your enemy. It will be the opposite of the things that impact your actual quality of life: is there a cafe, bar, coffee shop, or park you like chilling at? In my experience, Midtown East is way better for daily quality of life than Midtown West, but I'm not sure how many people realize how different it is.

5. Dating norms may be very different from where you came from, especially if it's college or not an urban center. You go on first dates to meet people like you used to through friends or at parties, so going on dozens of first dates with few seconds is precisely a sign you're doing it right and on schedule. Stop comparing online dating to what people did before online dating: turns out, tools like Yelp, Meetup and OKCupid make New York possible to live in for transplants in ways that it was simply insufferable a decade ago. Anyway, one rule: just try to enjoy your dates. Have good coffee, go to good shows. Figure out your own deal for how you're going to date, but if you do things you enjoy you'll be getting something out of it and growing in real ways that will help you going forward.

6. People in X work really long hours. Where X = med school, law school, finance, fashion, startup-anything; in fact, pretty much any job you can name people work really long hours. If someone complains about how hard they work, they're not at the top, and you can tell because they have time to complain about it. The moral is: don't compare yourself. Find time to relax or hang out, but one day a week may be enough for you, or you may need a dedicated and fulfilling evening routine.

7. It takes a half hour to get anywhere. You will be doing a lot less seeing people who you thought were nearby than you think. Try to make a habit out of reading on the subway, but don't expect this to actually be productive time.

8. New York is like college in this way: you can do anything. But you're not supposed to. Pick a major, maybe a second one, maybe a minor, and a few electives. It's okay to switch degrees. For me lately that has meant a major in classical music attending and a minor in coffee shops. But I'm not the best at finding restaurants here that really do it for me, and you know what? I'm not missing out. That's pretty okay.

9. Quick connections are very easy to make. People are friendly. Lasting connections are putative by default. Rule of thumb: anyone you manage to see once every 2 months is a good friend. If you might overlap in routine with someone, so that you can share downtime, invest in that friendship: it might mean morning coffee together, and heck, for me, once it meant doing laundry together with a girl who lived a block away. I saw her more than most of my "good friends" while we lived close. So when you meet someone new you have interest in, try to do that puzzle solving: how can our routines overlap? And if not, how are we going to hang 2 months from now? Facebook is very useful for maintaining light connections and getting them active periodically or sporadically.

10. If one thing in New York will break you, it's housing. There's no obvious advice here and no way around this fact. Try to have money or roommates lined up before you move here, those are the only things that really help with this. You will absolutely need a temporary housing arrangement in the city before getting a permanent one. In my case, I lived in Jersey and commuted to the city on weekends for a month, used that time to line up a 1-month sublease, and used that time to get a full year lease. At first this sounded bizarrely dragged out to me, but then I realized: I got so incredibly lucky for it to line up like that, because I really had no serious plan to make an apartment lease happen otherwise.

11. Don't not have a smartphone. If an article called "30 things I wish I knew before moving to New York" interested you, and you can't afford a smartphone/data plan, then you way shouldn't live here. Get Hopstop right away. Find a transit map that includes train times. Subways tend to be precise enough that times are meaningful. Yelp and Google Maps are the most important apps.

12. If you want to Craigslist a roommate, please please please live with someone in your general socioeconomic class. This is not a good time to learn the difference between personal classism and institutional classism, and be on the sore end of the latter.

13. Don't be rude to anyone. One time, my Dad had me try driving 65 in a 70. A few people passed me (and then many more), but do you know how incredibly easy driving got? So that wasn't really relevant, but something else I learned from watching my Dad over a few days in New York: I had way underestimated how much people will prefer a dragged out friendly interaction over a curt, to-the-point one. He could get anyone he talked to to laugh, it just might take an extra few minutes, which to my surprise, they had.

14. Earphones, all the time. You don't even need your music on that loud, but they serve as minor earplugs, which you'll find you're pretty much always thankful for. Approaching subway cars are loud, as are many vehicles (emergency, cement trucks, etc).

15. Stay during the storms. People get really, really friendly before impending disasters and especially during blackouts. This is actually sociologically well-documented: during natural disasters the rich and the poor suddenly start acting in communist brotherly love. But it also happens during things like hurricanes and blizzards and is SO much fun.

16. A word on budgets. This is less New York-dependent but applies if you've migrated up in cost of living or density. There is only one way you can stick to a budget: be illiquid. Note that broke is a subset of illiquid. The you at a club or bar or clothing store is not the you you want executing a budget. So move your short or medium-term savings (you do invest and have a 401(k), right?) to CDs (which are easy to withdraw from at generally a 3-month interest penalty) or liquid funds (Betterment), so you at least have to think a little bit to pull money out. If credit cards let you break this rule, then only carry debit cards: the 1% cash rewards is not even paying for your one splurge a month.

17. If you ever say I could do X if I make Y change, you will do Y and not do X. Y is usually moving somewhere. No joke: I've moved something like 5 times and have a 0% success ratio for predicting what projects or habits I would get into as a result of moving somewhere specific. See (4).

18. Always use the bathroom before leaving a restaurant. If you're going to be away from work or apartment all day, think about when your #2's are going to happen.

19. This is very specific but it's going to come up and totally clobber you: If you want to take the A train to Far Rockaway, get on the right half of the damn train. It's the only subway trip in the city I know of that has this catch to it, and it will blindside you, and you'll be in Ozone Park.

20. A brief guide to Queens: LIC or Astoria = transplant, Flushing = newly transplanted Asian (hasn't figured out how far it is yet) or native New York Asian, rest of Queens = native New York. It's okay to go to LIC or Astoria, people won't think you're weird. Only go to Flushing with someone who knows what the f*** they're doing. As for the rest of Queens, you do realize she lives with her parents still, right?

21. A brief guide to Brooklyn: Williamsburg and Greenpoint are the "hipster" parts but are arguably gentrified up already. I used to be able to keep track of where the hipsters are living now (I think it was briefly Bushwick but that already got expensive?) but now I can't keep up. They are not accessible from the rest of Brooklyn by transit, so practically speaking are a separate borough ("North Brooklyn"). Now, look for Prospect Park at a map and draw a rectangle with it as the southeast corner. That to Manhattan is what I call "near Brooklyn." Self-sufficient transplants live here. The rest is "far Brooklyn," which means you grew up in Brooklyn, plus wherever the hipsters live now, I'm not sure.

22. Local buses are slower than walking. Express buses are slower than jogging. Subways beat taxis during the day nearly always, and during the night over long distances.

23. It took me bizarrely long to stop lumping Whole Foods and Trader Joe's together. TJ's is literally < 1/2 the price. Do not recommend their produce.

24. Stop having an opinion on gentrification. Just, stop.

25. PSA: get a flu shot.

26. A brief guide to restaurants: Thai will be really good at first then you'll snub it for being Americanized. Italian is good. Desserts go in and out of style pretty rapidly. Chinese is good. Japanese is good, but sushi is bad. Korean is good, but what Korean restaurants you approve of fluctuates with how Asian you are. Mexican is pretty good but will be snubbed by people from SoCal. Bagels depend on the place. Pizza is good. Organic and farm-to-fresh is not as ubiquitous as you would think. Everyone eats at food carts; I only say this because every once in a while transplants get some bizarre idea they're tourist-traps and should be avoided. You will hear Queens has really authentic foreign food (e.g. Thai) but it will take you a couple years to get out there - start putting it off now.

27. Be mindful of white privilege (I'm saying this as a white person; I'm not even going to try to imagine how this applies to people of other racial background.)  Lacking mindfulness, you will tip white people more than you will tip Mexican or Asian people in service industries. You won't make this mistake with black people, since you've been trained from such a young age to not be racist.

28. You might be one of those people who makes fun of Instagram or people who check in on Foursquare or such. But those people are doing something way right that you are doing way wrong: keeping track of where they go. It's pretty sad when a year after living in New York you can name a total of 5 restaurants you've been to. Get in the habit of creating a digital papertrail somehow: if you're more privacy-aware just plug it into Google calendar, if you're less concerned then check in on FB, Foursquare, etc. #yolo

29. Don't complain about tipping, especially with taxi drivers. They work very, very long hours and make very little. Yes, you have to tip, and you have to tip well.

30. There are a handful of festivals and things in a given year that you'd rather not miss out on your first year. These include: Halloween, Pride, AIDS walk, Cherry Blossom Festival, restaurant weeks. I'll write up a full index some time when I get the chance. The correct response to "What are you doing for Pride?" isn't "I'm straight."
