## Is Classical period art the highest art?

Charles Rosen writes in *The Classical Style*:

> But the later eighteenth century made further demands: the mere rendering of sentiment was not dramatic enough; Orestes must be shown going mad *without his being aware of it*, Fiordiligi must desire to yield while trying to resist, Cherubino fall in love without knowing what it is that he feels, and, some years later, Florestan's despair give way and merge with his delirium and his apparently hopeless vision of Leonara. Dramatic sentiment was replaced by dramatic action.

To me, this is compelling and beautiful. And I've been considering author's other claim and ebbing argument that art for all of humanity peaked in the eighteenth century.

> Over-simply, during [the years preceding the Classical period] a composer had to choose between dramatic surprise and formal perfection, between expressitivity and elegance: he could rarely have both at once. Not until Haydn and Mozart, separately and together, created a style in which dramatic effect seemed at once surprising and logically motivated, in which the expressive and the elegant could join hands, did the classical style come into being.

Mirroring this, Douglas Hofstadter in *Godel, Escher, Bach* dicusses the kind of music computers must compose in crossing the threshold to true intelligence. Since I love this passage so much, I am sharing it in full:

> To think - and I have heard this suggested - that we might soon be able to command a preprogrammed mass-produced mail-order twenty-dollar desk-model "music box" to bring forth from its sterile circuitry pieces which Chopin or Bach might have written had they lived longer is a grotesque and shameful misestimation of the depth of the human spirit. A "program" which could produce music as they did would have to wander around the world on its own, fighting its way through the maze of life and feeling every moment of it. It would have to understand the joy and loneliness of a chilly night wind, the longing for a cherished hand, the inaccessibility of a distant town, the heartbreak and regeneration after a human death. It would have to have known resignation and world-weariness, grief and despair, determination and victory, piety and awe. In it would have had to commingle such opposites as hope and fear, anguish and jubilation, serenity and suspense. Part and parcel of it would have to be a sense of grace, humor, rhythm, a sense of the unexpected√êand of course an exquisite awareness of the magic of fresh creation. Therein, and therein only, lie the sources of meaning in music.

Therefore, we arrive at the argument that should humanity make the final breakthrough on artifical intelligence, it will essentially be because artificial intelligence is capable of experiencing and producing art as it was in the Classical period. 

## My own listening

Probably like many novices, I find Romantic era pieces filled with plot and dramatic action. They are most instantly recognizable as beautiful. By contrast, and this is me disappointing myself, late classical pieces sound filled with drama and excitement but never dramatic action. 

I listen to Chopin's *Ballades* and Liszt's *Lieds* with my own precise narratives. In one narrative, *Ballade No. 1*  is about a person in old age reminiscing their glory days, and  the piece is an artistic experiment in how powerful and transporting a memory can be. In another narrative, it's a young person enjoying the height of a wonderful summer, and feeling the power of that experience, yet not quite realizing the moment it had passed over. I can hear several narratives to the piece, but they all contain the same dramatic action. All narratives are about the transience of a glorious moment. The music expresses it with grace that I can't achieve in prose, which is perhaps the point of art anyway.

My problem is that I don't hear this dramatic action in the works of Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven. I believe it's there, it's just a little more hidden in the historical context of 18th century music, which we expediently package up and label as music theory. So I'm self-studying music history and theory, and hope to uncover some of the dramatic action that is said to make these works great.
