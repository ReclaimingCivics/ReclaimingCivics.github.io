### Re-read

1. GEB. Somehow need to get full value out of it this time.
2. Always good to revisit EPL.
3. Similarly, want to reread Jane Jacobs and get something out of it.
4. And Strange Loop.

### New

1. Karen Horney, Neuroses and Human Growth. That was kind of her important one, I feel by now.
2. Book by the Zappos guy. Probably important for business. Get Jojo to buy.
3. Design of everyday things.
4. Neil Irwin, *The Alchemists*
5. Nate Silver, *The Signal and the Noise*
6. The book Klein recommended on the oil boom
7. Current Wonkblog book club book regarding New Deal
8. Power of Introverts
9. I saw what looked like a pretty good intro quantum mechanics book straddling lay person and scientist.
10. 7 Habits of Highly Effective People? May as well.
11. Omnivore's Dilemma
12. You found a classical music series that looks worthwhile.
