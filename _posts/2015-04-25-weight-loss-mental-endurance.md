title: Mental endurance in weight loss
layout: post-index
---

I've been somewhat of a yo-yo dieter, and in the past few days I've taken some reflection on that. I'm reading *The Rock Warrior's Way*, and would say that I kinda-sorta know the content, but it's giving me a nice chance to compare my mental abilities at three activities: rock climbing, distance running, and weight loss.

For perspective, I weigh about 190 lbs. right now and weighed about 180 lbs. 6 months ago. I felt pretty lean at 180 lbs. and shirts just started fitting me better in general. I think I would feel fully lean around 170 lbs., and haven't really thought about what comes next.

My conclusion is pretty simple: You know the difference between physical strength and endurance? Well, when it comes to weight loss, I have pretty good mental strength and pretty undeveloped mental endurance. There are key points in the weight loss marathon I bonk out.

### Envisioning success

Interestingly, my weight loss strategies only fail when I start really showing signs of success. One winter I was totally off sweets. Then one fateful day, I went to a yoga class, ran 9.5 miles - my personal best at the time! - arrived at Smorgasburg, saw a vegan donut stand, and was defenseless. My defenses didn't fall for only one day; rather, that was the end of that diet.

Another time I got my weight down to 181 lbs. And immediately stepped off the scale and ate something. I did not weigh below 181 lbs. during that diet.

I have somewhat of a tortured relationship with success. I have, in fact, grown a lot of identity in being "not quite there" in many areas of my life, thinness first and foremost. I'll spare the full analysis, but a lot of my relationships are fueled by working on my own problems, and they would feel very at-risk to me if certain problems ceased to be. (Egotistical, I know.)

So that's the problem, but I think the solution lies in a different mentality altogether. There are probably many ways someone can be afraid of success, but in any case, they all indicate an underdeveloped "seeing myself as successful" mental muscle. That is one of the longterm mental muscles in weight loss or any athletic success: so develop it, with time and practice.

I have mental *strength*, but lack mental *endurance*. Envisioning success is a key juncture in mental endurance.

### My silly ego complex with dieting

I have two problems with failing at dieting: one, that I don't know how to cope with slipping for one day without it meaning the whole diet failed, and two, that I don't like being an ordinary person who tries and fails sometimes.

To the latter, my failures are accompanied by true but ultimately irrelevant rationalizations. I'll fall back on the fact that I look and feel good now, or I really enjoy rock climbing or running so it's not about the weight loss, which is all true, but it washes away this little voice that says, "I want to be lean." Which I do. But I don't like having that desire right after the moment I cheat on my diet, so I wash it away.

The truth is, part of being a centered person is believing that life is pretty okay right now. But that can become a defense mechanism against failure at long term goals. That is the secret.

### Asking "What's different this time?""

My other major problem with dieting is that I don't know how to cope with small failures. I think, "what's different?" this somehow goes back to my ego complex, although I'm not quite sure how to say it. But *I* have to be special and innovative. I don't like failing and trying again, I like failing and innovating a new strategy.

That is also a mental endurance muscle: being able to fail once and keep going. And if you've never developed this muscle, why would you expect it to be strong?

This is good to realize. Because every time I ignore the voie that says "What's different?" I take some humility in being an ordinary person who can fail at a diet. I actually become a little stronger through that humility, and *that's* what's different.

### I've never just *asked* for help

Again, the silly ego complex is preventing me. I have a lot of dieting and exercise figured out. That's why I'm sometimes successful. But would it really hurt me to get over the "eww" factor and find and read a good diet or nutrition book, or ask some questions to a nutritionist or trainer? Or more to the point: shouldn't I start asking how to win the mental endurance marathon to a trainer or fitness community?

### Inventorying my strengths and weaknesses

I have a fair bit of both. So, here goes, in the order that I thought of them:

*Strength*: I actually enjoy short-term dieting. I'm pretty good at cutting sweets / fried food for a while.

*Strength*: When I'm performing optimally, I'm not stressed or too into it, and lose weight.

*Strength*: My vacation time in Seattle was magically productive and I can go there again.

*Weakness*: I would rather feel unique in how I ease up on my goal,than accept failure.

*Weakness*: I haven't learned how to build in "cheat days", and take cheats too hard. In general I cope badly when I break my rules.

*Strength*: I've realized I partner up pretty well.

*Strength*: I'm pretty innovative. Basically every gimmick I've come up with has worked for a while.

*Weakness*: I *insist* on being innovative instead of trying tried-and-proven ways.

*Strength*: I have a pretty good sense of a healthy diet for me. I don't need to consult a diet book to know how to eat to meet my goals.

*Weakness*: I'm a bit too closed off to advice, especially when it comes to the marathon junctures in a diet, e.g. having cheat days.
