"It is not enough to be busy, we must ask: 'What are we busy about?'" -- Thoreau

"What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention." --social scientist Herbert Simon

"The most basic form of human stupidity is forgetting what we are trying to accomplish." -- Nietzsche

*Quotes taken from *Manage Your Day-to-Day*, a book that will try to sell you another book every four pages, but was a useful enough tool for me to think through my productivity problems and solutions.*

Yes, I am writing yet another "we are too distracted by technology and have no time for solitude" blog post. But I'm writing it to share two things: that I simply had no idea how deep this problem goes in my own life, and that I was able to realize this when I started auditing how much I get done of things that are actually important to me.

People budget well. (Okay, that's a lie, but bear with me.) We more or less understand that if we spend money on a bottle of water or a trip to Taiwan depending on our relatively level of affluence, we will have less money at some other point in our life. We also understand this is true with our time, most acutely when budgetting a finite number of vacation days or sick days. But what very few people understand is this is also true of our attention.

What if you could only check your email three times a day, Facebook two times, and your phone twelve times?  Well, that's silly, because there's no reason not to just check these things whenever. Or maybe we'll create a morning ritual where we don't check our phone until we've been awake an hour, and create periods of one or two hours in the day when we unplug from distractions. And, wow, those strategies - basically, the ones I've been employing - are so completely insufficient.

A couple weeks ago I actually wrote up the projects I really care about. I've given up first on learning Chinese then on learning Chopin's Nocturne No. 19 for piano, but narrowed down to a few more reasonable ones.  They are:  complete a machine learning course on Coursera, implement Logstash at work, and learn front-end web development. Nice and technological. What I was expecting to find when I paid attention to my priorities is that I was making little progress on my more important projects because I kept thrashing between them. What I actually found was **that I was spending no time on my important projects at all.**

In reaction, I applied some time management tools I already know. Shut down social media for an hour here and there, and really focus. The result is I bumped the needle up from zero hours a week to around three.

Okay, I understand this. It's because I'm a very busy person. But busy with what? The things that are *actually* important to me are clearly not receiving my attention. And I realized that my attention is, in fact, entirely going into the instant gratification of social media, email, and news. You could seriously argue my life would be better if I had no smartphone and no internet connection in my apartment.

That may be too extreme, but I am considering the following:

* why should I ever be logged into GChat, unless I explicitly want to talk to a friend? Don't I have pretty important things to be attending to most of the time?
* why should I check Facebook more than once a week?
* Why should I ever check the news outside of times I have explicitly designated for news-checking? (After all, I have more important projects to be doing all the time, and therefore must *make time* for news. Not vice versa.)
* why should I ever check my smartphone when getting up, into the elevator at work, etc.? Nothing important could possibly happen there that is more important than letting my mind relax for a minute.

Unlike every other time I've read a post on productivity, I can realize all of this now, because I actually have real opportunity cost that I can trace down to my attention deficit caused by my interaction with technology.

So, essentially, I'm now practicing inverting my relationship. Things are off by default. Do not stay logged into Facebook. Most apps on my phone I really have no reason to have on my phone, so delete them. Stay logged out of GChat when logged into Gmail. Stay logged out of Gmail - yes, type in my password and even my SMS code, since those few extra seconds are pennies on the distraction an email check invokes in the first place (and therefore those pennies make the perfect barrier). Look forward to talking to and hanging out with my friends instead of expecting to catch up with them at random points in the day.

Ah, what's that? I feel so much lighter now. Like I just removed 20 things from my mind that I didn't know were there. That's better.
