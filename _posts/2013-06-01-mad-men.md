I'm glad to be taking this show in better now. Right now I'm very tired but it's not quite late enough to sleep, but I'm too tired to actually work on something.

Not long ago *Mad Men* struck me as too slow for me to get into initially, but now it strikes me as just right. I take in more information from people now, so the pacing is very filling.

Recently I've implemented analytics and user action tracking on a website. It was very interesting witnessing the tobacco executives, pre-data, pre-science, actually believe in their product, with seemingly no speck of belief that tobacco actually is dangerous. It was an epistemology I was able to perceive and empathize with, so it was natural and sensical to watch Pete mess it up by getting too scientific, and Don make the sale by empathizing with the clients.

In some ways simplistic, but it was nice to finally be able to watch this episode and take in that interaction fully.
