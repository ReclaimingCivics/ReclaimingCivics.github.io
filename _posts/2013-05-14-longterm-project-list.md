Probably as a result of my time working at Bloomberg and learning project management there, I've had the philosophy that it's much better to keep your would-like-to-do list active. In Bloomberg, long-running, inactive projects and tasks are frowned-upon by the design of these systems.

But I think that's not everything. It's important to maintain a big running list of things one might like to do not with any intention of getting any fraction of them done. Just, so that when the mood strikes, when once every few months I want to read a new book or invest in a hobby, I have a fighting chance of actually remembering the gazillion things I had fleeting interest in when I *didn't* have time. So this list I expect to maintain and let grow, with light pruning and little more. (This is under source control, after all.)
