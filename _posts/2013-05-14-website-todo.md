Perhaps this post more than any shows what I'm doing here. My to-do's for this site straddle the line between a project I am working on and just how I live and organize my thoughts. Before this writing, these are in a journal entry somewhere, and this website operates more like a more cogent and horizontally accessible journal to me. Google Docs then Evernote, never quite figuring out whether an Asana task was lightweight, and so forth have never felt anything other than cluttered, but organizing so that others might experience some of my interiority has changed that. So this goes here.

1. Links to all public profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow)
2. Functional email @echl.in
3. Weak semblance of a "private" post. The "personal" category is still public but is basically too boring so that I want it on display
4. Category descriptions should display from category page
5. Customize CSS in some meaningful way
6. Posts should appear on front page
7. Figure out how to manage comments (where do they go??)
8. Plug in Olark
9. Functional RSS feed, ideally split by category
10. Get rid of the annoying categories @ bottom of post
