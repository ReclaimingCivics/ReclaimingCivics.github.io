I spent some time hammering out the details of Verizon's Edge plan today and wanted to share.

# tl;dr

Take excellent care of your phone, which you must now give back when you're finished using it. You can upgrade a little sooner and it's not as brutally expensive, once you meet the rest of the plan's requirements, of which there are several

# Executive Summary

The deal is an instance of somewhat better service for premium customers. Think of these four ways you can be a premium customer: You like upgrading at 18 months instead of 24, you have a premium insurance plan, your account uses at least 6 GB of data a month (personal or family plan), and you never sell old phones for whatever reason. If these four things are true, Edge helps you.

Termination costs go up over all, but are a little more fair in two senses. One is the non-pecuniary, but I feel relevant, psychological sense that you pay for the phone, not for an abstract fee, if you leave early. Two is it doesn't cost as much to break a contract at the end of it, and if you want to leave your contract at month 22 of 24, it is inexpensive to do so.

Non-premium consumers are hurt in a few ways. One, they are now committed to an aggressive upgrade model, and must buy insurance, because there is no discounted upgrade if their phone is not in pristine shape. Two, the used phone market is killed because Verizon consumes old phones as part of the plan - so the non-premium consumer has their recourse blown out as well.

This is part of the usual trend across corporations of better service for premium customers and screwing over poor customers as much as possible. Sorry, that's the blunt talk. Now for how to deal with it as a premium customer.

# The relevant details (to me)

Here's what I gathered:

* Once you are eligible for upgrade - I can't remember how it works for your first Edge phone, but for your second Edge phone, it's when it's 75% paid off (60% for older contracts).
* If you terminate your contract, you are responsible for the full balance on the phone. This is actually pretty draconian, and given that phones are $600+, it might actually be more punishing than the older "early terimination" model.
* Your phone must be in pretty good shape. They define this to mean no cracks on the screen, no water damage, and it turns on. Look at your phone right now, and observe that it might be in worse shape than this.
* If you didn't get the insurance plan before, you probably want it now. It's about $10/month with about a $150 deductible.
* You must pay your phone in payments over 2 years. If your phone costs $600, you must pay $600/24 = $25 / month.
* If you want to upgrade in less than 18 months, you must pay $25 per month.
* If your account has at least a 6 GB data plan, you get a $25/month discount. So a $600 phone is fully paid off by the discount. Note this can apply to all family members on a shared 6 GB plan.
* You are eligible for a (relatively speaking) free upgrade 18 months into your contract (15 months on older plans), upon trading in your phone.

# What should you actually do?

For me, 18 months has been a more practical upgrade cycle. I like new things and break old things. Therefore:

* I definitely get the insurance, and expect to pay the deductible, in 18 months. That's $280 for the upgrade. Furthermore, since I change in my old phone, I can't keep it as a backup, so I doubly need the insurance plan.
* I plan to upgrade every 18 months.
* I stay on a family plan to hit the 6 GB limit.

# What should you watch out for?

Here are some ways you may be screwed:

* Discounted upgrades are *gone*. If you sold your phone before, that is vanished, and this deal is now suddenly very expensive for ou.
* Take *pristine* care of your phone. It used to be that you could shatter or even merely scratch your screen and keep using it, then wait for the upgrade. Now, you can't do that. That scratched phone is not eligible for upgrade.
* If you didn't get the insurance before, you probably want it now, and even if you don't need to use it, your upgrade will be $180 just off the $10/month payments.
* Early termination fees are brutal - a $600 phone in the beginning, tapers down to $150 at 18 months, at which point you probably upgrade your phone.

And of course, any of the myriad ways this plan will change:

* Monthly payments are edged up, because we know consumers put up with monthly payments more than they put up with more expensive phones.
* The used phone market is edged out, so when yours breaks, there's nowhere to turn.
* The 6 GB limit to be eligible for the credit is edged up. Welcome to being a premium data user.
* Time until upgrade is edged up as usual. This is doubly bad because your old phone must hold on for dear life for this time.
* Requirements for an old phone's condition are edged up. This is, of course, only a problem if you didn't buy the best, most durable Android phone. Sorry, mid-tier customers.
