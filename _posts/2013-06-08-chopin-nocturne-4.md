Nocturne No. 4 is the piece where I learned to recognize and listen to the A-B-A form. In a nutshell, the point of an A-B-A form piece is to see what it feels like to experience the A the second time, in light of what one has gained or learned or gone through from the B section. Accordingly, B sections are often dark and stormy, so the second A section becomes poignant instead of merely blissful.

The reason this piece did it for me is because the two themes are so dramatic and exaggerated by Chopin's standards. He's a dramatic composer in general but I haven't heard another piece whose sections take it to such an extreme, essentialized degree.
