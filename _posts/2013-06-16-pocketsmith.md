title: Pocketsmith is promising, but I haven't found a workflow that works yet

I'm finding Mint.com has shortcomings, so after spending literally an entire day researching other apps, I settled on Pocketsmith. Thus far, my experience with them is that they have very modern UI and very not modern UX. However, over corresponding with their support and following their site resources (like their wiki!) I've concluded that they are very worth watching

#### What can't I do in Mint.com?

I have the following budget questions:

* Am I doing a good job of spending healthily each month?  Not too much on taxis, bars, eating out, etc.?
* Do I actually have good net income over time? Or am I tricking myself into thinking that since I didn't eat out that much I'm saving money, when in reality I'm way underestimating costs like doctors, emergency trips home, etc.

And Mint.com is really bad at solving probems like:

* I paid taxes but saved up each month for it, maybe you could not make it look like my spending in April was drastically out of control?
* I pay my trainer typically < once a month. Can we do anything to make it look less like I have great months and terrible months?
* How is my budget doing less fixed expenses?  Mint.com makes it look like my spending is way out of control after I pay rent, since I write one big fat check each month instead of small payments each day.

Ultimately, I'm looking for a budget with the right amount of meaning. I want to know I'm saving money each month, but I'm also willing to say, okay, trainer doesn't count as much since I'm willing to pay for that from my savings (this is a personal financial decision). And I want to use my budget as a tool that says, "you really should be spending less on eating out," but one that says

And, furthermore, I don't particularly expect much out of them going forward. They were founded in 2006 and acquired in 2009. I haven't used them enough to know if most of what makes them useful has happened since 2009, but as is usually the case when an old-world company buys up a disruptive technology, they're likely done with UX and technology innovation and are working on fleshing out revenue (more ads).

####Pocketsmith's promise and delivery

**Pocketsmith's concept is - or should be - transform your transaction history into your budget.**  But I was unable to make this workflow happen, due to too many UI weaknesses.  Ideally transactions will belong to budgets, and one's that don't are actionable. Then I have to do maintenance when a transaction doesn't fall under a budget, or when a budget goes over. That's a pretty reasonable workflow, and a pretty reasonable amount of attention for my budget to demand.


Here is how far I got down the workflow, and where it broke down.

* Firstly, you have to account for transactions properly. For me, transactions include credit card payments, and occasional transfers between, say, checking and savings accounts. These will be littered throughout all pages.  

    The easiest way to track these down is via the cashflows page, because a transfer will show up as dubious income. Identify the transfer, then find it via a search from the "Merchants" page.  

    *However* I do *not* know whether Pocketsmith will automate these corrections. I think this is possible by creating filters, but it's not like I knew or remembered to do that when categorizing everything.

* Next, I had the problem that things like my income, rent, and who knows what else were duplicated across cashflows page. This is troubling, because [all of these charts and budgets are pretty useless if on top of bad data.](http://xkcd.com/937/)

* Moving forward, Personal Summary > Categories seems like a good way to set up a budget. The problem is I have 77 categories and cannot maintain 77 different budgets. And they're not ordered or weighted by amount I spend, which kind of creates a dead end here.

* "Calendar" is where the budget should actually live. Past is driven by transaction, future by budgets. Ideally I would be able to see which transactions were budgeted for and add transactions to budgets, but it's not even possible to create a budget from this page as far as I can tell.

They do have numerous other small bugs, but the only problems that a patient power user who desperately needs a good product can't deal with are the bad data and no good UI where the workflow should be.

Ultimately, my budget goal is that **all spending should be spent judiciously.** I don't care that I wrote a "large check" (in Mint parlance) for personal trainer. I care that I planned to. Going over budget on eating out is a far bigger problem to me.I'm looking for a service that can, essentially, catch and highlight the problem transactions that I need to bring more focus to. Pocketsmith doesn't quite deliver, but I'll be keeping my eye on them.
