I wrote up my own 7-minute workout. I had the following goals:

* a bit more focus on core
* silent exercises, that will work with someone living in an apartment below me
* low peak cardio and easy recovery between exercises
* some stretching in areas my flexibility needs work
* easy to do without a timer

I augmented with the following "rules":

* Pace against my own breath. Take long or short breaks between exercises until I breathe evenly. I'm not trying to rush this or make this discouraging.
* Just estimate 30 seconds. It's more important to find a number of reps that's rhythmic and effective.
* Try to do about two sets, but it's okay to do more or less. Don't be discouraging.

And came up with these:

#### Plank

The foundation of core! And requires exertion.

#### Hollow body belly rocks

#### Crunches (any style)

#### Deep side bends

More of a stretch and the point is to go deeper, not to do more reps. About 2 reps each side. This would be a good, but very different, high-exertion oblique workout at higher reps.

#### Push ups

Vanilla. Push ups are challenging enough that I think adding variations is only discouraging.

#### Bridge

A good butt exercise, which helps with planks. Also a quad stretch if I'm particularly tight there.

#### Hollow body back rocks

#### Squats

Perfect the form.

#### Thigh cries

Requires squat form, but more dynamic and with more cardio exertion.

#### Toe touch, yoga style

Like a sun salute. A stretch, but done as a sun salute to create a very fluid, liquid form. It's a good hamstring stretch any time, but is very refreshing and corrects my posture no matter what.

#### Left side plank

#### Right side plank

#### T-squares

I don't know a good name, but on your back, lift your legs up, down, out, in, up down, and so forth. Try to hold it for a count of 1 at the top.
