I wrote up my own 7-minute workout. I had the following goals:

* a bit more focus on core
* silent exercises, that will work with someone living in an apartment below me
* low peak cardio and easy recovery between exercises
* some stretching in areas my flexibility needs work
* easy to do without a timer

I augmented with the following "rules":

* Pace against my own breath. Take long or short breaks between exercises until I breathe evenly. I'm not trying to rush this or make this discouraging.
* Just estimate 30 seconds. It's more important to find a number of reps that's rhythmic and effective.
* Try to do about two sets, but it's okay to do more or less. Don't be discouraging.

And came up with these:

1. **Plank** - The foundation of core! And requires exertion.
2. **Hollow body belly rocks**
3. **Crunches (any style)**
4. **Deep side bends** - More of a stretch and the point is to go deeper, not to do more reps. About 2 reps each side. This would be a good, but very different, high-exertion oblique workout at higher reps.
5. **Push ups** - Vanilla. Push ups are challenging enough that I think adding variations is only discouraging.
6. Bridge - A good butt exercise, which helps with planks. Also a quad stretch if I'm particularly tight there.
7. **Hollow body back rocks**
8. **Squats** - Slow, even form. Take about 60 seconds because it's worth it.
9. **Thigh cries** - Requires squat form, but more dynamic and with more cardio exertion.
10. **Toe touch, yoga style** - Like a sun salute. A stretch, but done as a sun salute to create a very fluid, liquid form. It's a good hamstring stretch any time, but is very refreshing and corrects my posture no matter what.
11. **Left side plank**
12. **Right side plank**
13. **T-squares** - I don't know a good name, but on your back, lift your legs up, down, out, in, up down, and so forth. Try to hold it for a count of 1 at the top.
