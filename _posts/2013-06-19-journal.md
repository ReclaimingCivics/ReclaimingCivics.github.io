Here are some goals I've been slacking on:

1.  Waking up early, period.  I've been setting my alarm early then snoozing.  Meditations have shown it and have honestly even been frustrating, since I know I've been falling asleep during them.  I'm hoping time at the Ashram this weekend will be somewhat restorative.  I kind of want to spend time reading some of the mission books, listening to videos, etc., and I know the ashram is the place to do this.

2.  Exercise on both the morning and evening ends.  These areas have been neglected:

    - Runs with Mitha, especially evening
    - waking up early and doing standard set in morning
    - or doing standard set in evening
    - or doing much of any exercise on weekends

3.  Writing.  I should, honestly, be spending a lot of time on this.

4.  Not putting the hours needed at work.  Need to both stay later on standard, probably 7:30 most nights, and get in early, probably more like 9:15 maybe 9:30.
