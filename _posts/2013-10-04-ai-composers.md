I read [Hofstadter's piece](http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?216450) on how computer-generated music is catching up and has even passed some Turing Tests - and worse, Turing Tests where the human is Bach or Chopin. He boils it down to three possibilities:

>(1) Chopin (for example) is a lot shallower than I had ever thought.  
(2) Music is a lot shallower than I had ever thought.  
(3) The human soul/mind is a lot shallower than I had ever thought.

I find this to be woefully unimaginative. I understand music to be, in some perhaps flippant and analogical, perhaps literal sense, isomorphic to pieces of the human mind. When I listen to Beethoven's *Waldstein* Sonata and hear energy and excitement, and wonder if the piece is so brilliant and heroic that even more excitement and jubilation - to the extent that I *actually feel excited and joyful* - then, that proves it. It proves the piece had that.

Hofstadter has written at length (like, books) about the diffuseness of consciousness. As a corollary to that, one must take the genius or emotiveness of music to be diffuse.

Based on this linked piece he wrote way back in 2002, computers were then at a point when they found ways to chop up and reassemble pieces to wind up with results that can pass Turing tests, even when the human judge is a trained composer or a lover of classical music.

This is how I think of that: there's some basic feelings and emotions we have, that are mostly biochemical. Then we make things like love (which is a bit more than attraction) and victory (which is a bit more than the moment adrenaline starts to decline because one didn't die) from these. If a computer figures out how to incite some of these basic emotions, and a *human* judge reacts to them in such a way that produces brilliant higher emotions, then that's beautiful. The human judge adds immense value to this.

I'm willing to wax poetic here and make unfalsifiable claims to make myself feel better about being human (hey, that's why I write: to find unfalsifiable ways to feel good about being alive), but I think I can argue purely from Hofstadter again. One of his favorite performers is Albert Schweitzer, who, when he performs Bach, invokes incredible kindness and humanity, reflecting the incredible kindness and humanity in his own life. And when Hofstadter listens to Schweitzer perform Bach, there are at least three souls interacting: Bach's, Schweitzer's, and Hofstader's. And when I listen to Schweitzer, trying to hear something that Hofstadter found compelling, that's four souls. I'm just abbreviating arguments from *I Am A Strange Loop*. But the human listener is clearly an integral part of where the livelihood in the music happens.

I'll be a little more worried when an artificial intelligence is capable of evaluating and reacting to beautiful music, but this too amounts to nothing, because it was the human sentience that the composer had to impress in the first place. We can carry this further: maybe some genetic algorithm on an AI judge can produce a judge that can pass a meta-Turing test. But this isn't any different from the original situation, because - there is still a human judge. How do you remove the human judge from the picture? When AIs can react to music of their own accord and need no consultation with a human to be validated? Won't that be when they are sentient - and even more strongly, wouldn't that constitute sentience? So, I think Hofstadter's decades-old claim still holds ground. Perhaps one must still choose of his three options, but I hope to have revealed that humans and composers interact in such a way that these choices are less threatening.


Isn't the Turing Test broken when the judge contributes much of the humanity he or she is evaluating? I think so. I think we'll share our consciousness with music and machines in fascinating ways, and it's in our interest to recognize that we play an important part in the sentience that inhabits the universe, but our own minds are not the locus of this spark anymore than our brains or bodies are. This is, admittedly, optimistic of me. Sometimes the immense suffering in the human and animal worlds troubles me viscerally. Sometimes I spook myself over the thought of nothingness after death, regardless of what I've read or learned about consciousness or spirituality. But, one thing that has yet to threaten my humanity in the slightest is the great strides made by artificial composers. And it would be difficult for an AI composer to threaten my humanity, because nothing an AI composer can do can divorce its history and evolution from my humanity.
