I think part of the recentering problem comes in losing sight of this much more than I would expect. My main buckets look something like this:

* I want to be healthy, above all else
* I want to be thoroughly disciplined. I want consistency
* I want my mind to be structured robustly in a way that makes it resistant to anxieties and less prone to depression
* I want to put good food in my body. I want to be conscientious of what I am eating
* I want to be up early
* I want to write

And I think I tend to not recall these in enough detail when I'm in need of recentering. Sometimes being uncentered comes to not mindfully connectinSo, this post is something of an attempt to correct that.


##### Exercise

**Exercise is one of the most important things.**
