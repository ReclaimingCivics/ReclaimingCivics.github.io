####Routine

1. Try creating blocks of 2-4 hour "creative" time. Learning, programming, whatever takes focus. In particular Gmail needs to be closed and you will need a strategy to not get distracted with music left and right (even though I think it's okay to listen to music).  Simple rule - if you had ANY distraction in an hour, the entire hour is invalidated. This could be hard with your work culture, but if you start by being harshly to self-originating distractions (Facebook, fiddling with music, Gmail) and permit coworker-originating distractions, you can stay basically agreeable and still have quality work hours.

2. Avoid becoming a workaholic. Get stuff done during the day. Make your boundaries.

3. "A small daily task, if it be really daily, will beat the labours of a spasmodic Hercules." Imagine what you could accomplish. Piano, Chinese - some of these big ones suddenly seem schedulable.

4.  Consider every day on projects instead of once a week. Keeps work fresh, moving, easy to start.

5.  What renewal habits can you build into your day?  Walk around lunch?  Coffee run?  Smoothie run?  Leave phone behind?

6.  Committing to ignore distractions exhausts attention.  How do you deal with *this* fact as a programmer?

7.  Task switching leads to a "hangover effect," where you keep working on the first task.  Seek completion.

8.  I really don't see any reason not to
 * sign out of Facebook and check it about once a week
 * sign out of gchat, similar logic. Friends I care about talking to I can gradually migrate to a "when we actually want to talk" system.
 * delete most apps on my phone that I check

  I mean, the basic story here is there's tremendous opportunity cost in having my attention going into these things at all, that's totally unaccounted for. And the more I see what I *actually* want to be working on and how I'm *not* working on it, the more I believe that opportunity cost ought to show up.

  9. Stagger mindful and mindless work.

  10. Preserve unstructured moments as well as unstructured time. Phone checks are "expensive." I'm not sure how to do this while still owning a smartphone.
