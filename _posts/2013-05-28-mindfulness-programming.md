One of the things that attracts me to the programming profession is the immense amount of mindfulness it requires, and the variety and consortium of modes of thinking one must be capable of navigating - and this navigation-ability is itself a faculty which requires *immense* mindfulness, and I think the holy grail of being a strong programmer.  Some styles of thinking one needs to be in at any given time include:

* Head down and hack.  Sometimes you get bursts of a few hours to even days or weeks of knowing pretty much what code needs to be written, and just needed to sit down and write it.  The more this happens the better of a job of everything else you've done has been. Things feel rote. The more that feels rote, the stronger of a programmer you are. It's where you are most likely to get that tingle of putting off going to the bathroom or eating for hours on end as you keep thinking "just this one more thing," because you're in "the zone."  Which is a very interesting abstraction, because it's abstracted as a place, whereas the feeling is actually a stream of waterfall of just these "one more thing..." whose continuity adds up to being in "the zone."

* Think about how to improve workflow, whether it involves learning new Eclipse shortcuts or trying out a new editor.

* Step back and redesign perhaps a few classes or even a fairly large rearchitecting of an application's code.

* Figure out longer term maintenance and architectural improvements that are needed.  You're in constructor hell because you don't have an IoC framework?  You're in callback hell because you don't have a strong Promise library?

* Am I actually solving the right business problem?

Now, the point I want to make in writing this post is that **these tend to be synergistic, *not* contrary.**  And the way these manifest as synergy is, when in a mindful, focused state, jumping between these modes of thinking doesn't actually feel like stepping out and contemplating doesn't actually *break* one's workflow.  The Mindful One in your consciousness *stays* in the zone.  For instance:

* A novice programmer may be very good at using the handful of Java methods he knows (saying "he" because I'm thinking of myself past to prsesent here), but gets thrown off at having to research how to use a new class.  However before too long, he can either figure it out without actually having to leave Eclipse, or knows to jump to the Javadocs or a highly upvoted StackOverflow answer, and glean the information pretty quickly.

* A novice programmer may get thrown off at having to do a class redesign.  A more experienced programmer may recognize that he is wrestling the existing structure of a class and pull out a notebook and start writing down class requirements, instead of going into an unfocused, meandering, contemplative mode.

* A novice programmer may try to avoid improving IDE or tools use because he feels weak in the tool and will need to read up on how to use it correctly later. An experienced programmer can with great sensitivity *feel* when workflow seems clunky, and quickly Google up how to do something, so his knowledge of his IDE is keeping up with his workflow, more than the other way around.

So in general, experience in programming means moving over things from being "hard" to things being "rote." Your first language was hard. Your first functional language was hard. A few languages down the road? About as simple as learning the syntax of a few paradigms, Googling up how to use a debugger, making sure you know how to use the package manager and such, and off you go.

I would say:  if you find yourself *wrestling* with your IDE or *hard* to switch modes of thought, the problem isn't so much whatever you're working on right now, the problem is how you are going about the rest of your day and life. Are you well-rested? Caffeinated and *proud* of it?  (You know, so that when you feel the *caffeine* bump, you don't realize it as something that feels bad, but something that feels energizing and good). Have you undergone whatever ritual you need to keep whatever demons you are dealing with at bay, or are those begging more focus? In some ways, mindfulness while programming is the lack of such distractions, including distractions in one's personal life, distractions of thinking of one's product or what language or technology to learn or introduce next, and becoming a more *mindful* programmer means training oneself to recognize when these aberrations surface and deal with them outside of the code at hand. In other words, it's pretty hard to force focus when you need it; it must be germinated before you need it.
