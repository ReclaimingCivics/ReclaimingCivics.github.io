#### Not really tasks.

1. Stick with 6 AM meditation. It's doing a lot to erect your daily schedule / cycle. Even this time spent cleaning and 10 PM time spent writing up on stuff a bit comes a bit. There's this sort of "habit" v. "passion" debate, and you're getting pockets of introspection from having strong habit, lately. That's a really good thing. Still a little tricky to figure out what to do with the introspective pockets. Right now you're opting for task journaling into blog, then putting some more journal-like thoughts in it, which is a little unusual but okay. It's the right thing from which to improve.
