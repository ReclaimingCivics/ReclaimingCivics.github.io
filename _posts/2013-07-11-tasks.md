1. Suzanne Vega 4 volume collection. Sounds interesting.

### Focus on

1. I have a good set of morning workouts. Want to actually be doing them. I'm also thinking - nutrition is going to be a more demanding topic in my life. Congratulations, I suppose. I almost just think I would rather control exercising regularly out of my workouts and just get it down to nutrition. That means work out every day so I know the only remaining problems are nutritional. But we'll see.
