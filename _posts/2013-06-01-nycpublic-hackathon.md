title: NYCPublic Hackathon - Starting with a problem, not a solution

It's actually kind of amazing how much I learned today, including about what projects are viable during hackathons.

* This hackathon's greatest strength was also its greatest weakness, but I think, for my involvement, it was the right tradeoff.  The theme was creating apps to help the parents of public school students, and I enjoyed the specificity of it.  Furthermore, it was structured in a way that involved parents and teachers, along with designers and developers.  This created the strength of real problems from real people happening in a room, and the challenge of teasing out a product and project vision from a diverse group of people.

* In particular, working on a real problem is something of a top-down approach, whereas a hackathon to me connotes a bottom-up approach. This hackathon is, essentially, real parents coming to a forum with real problems. This means that whatever problems they have are real problems in need of a solution. This is invaluable to me, because one of the chief difficulties of hacking isn't solved so much as it simply becomes irrelevant: whatever problem we solve won't have been solved before, because we start with the *problem*.

* This is real world in the sense that it puts the developer in the shoes of a business consultant, who walked into a problem and has to figure out what the heck to do. A solution involving zero code is a great success and is completely in scope.  I was wondering if this might be the case early in the day - we were describing web apps that seemed to be fairly common problems. The other developers seemed to agree, and our first step was basically what might have been done in the space already.

* I was really pleasantly surprised to see how we finished with a very cohesive vision. The parents, the day prior, had put together quite complicated apps. But we were able to look at these proposals and find very simple common solutions in them. We realized that all we were really talking about was an app-website: a place where parents could participate, give and receive information and move up the pipeline from concerned parent to active volunteer. I think it took much of the day for us to realize that the website that we knew was the common ground and the complicated web app vision actually added up to a product we could make.

* The existing website was Wordpress.  I've wanted to increase my Wordpress fluency so I was very grateful for a chance to learn some things about it. I understand better how plugins add functionality: they will encapsulate the database work; which maybe sounds sort of obvious, but it was a learnable moment for me.

* The greatest learnable moment for me was when I realized that the basic schema and workflow that some of the developers worked out wasn't a complicated webapp at all.  It was a schema that pretty neatly plugged in to both a database schema as well as a UX workflow.  I realized that this was actually a product of precisely the right size for a hackathon:  the complicated web app was actually something that could be distilled into a simple schema.  I saw some complications but we were able to sort them out quickly, and have a neat, clean schema remaining.

    A lot of "complicated web-apps" are just pushing data around. Of course I've known this for a while, but it was somewhat magical seeing a complicated project turn into just that, and nothing more, and for us as a team to decide this was a reasonable goal for a couple days.

    This "full-stack developer" thing is starting to make sense to me. When projects like that start sounding easy and straightforward, more at the level of "assembling" code than innovating or coding, I'll be able to accomplish a whole heck of a lot. It's also good to realize that inflection point: when a project feels straightforward and like the coding is rote and low risk is the point at which risks diminish and estimates can be reasonably produced. It's good to recognize this.
