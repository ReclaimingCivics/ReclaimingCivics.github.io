title: Why I want to learn web development

I've been "more of a backend" engineer for my career thus far, but lately at my startup have worked my way toward a full stack developer - as of this writing I've worked on page navigation and routing and data elements in HTML tags, but not on CSS or presentation - and while this is a fine career, and arguably or depending on perspective a more prestigious one, it's important to me to go the rest of the way up the stack.

Pretty simply, I view a developer as a business consultant or problem solver, who happens to be able to use technology to solve business problems.  Sometimes, the developer uses hard technology and has to dabble more on the "research" end of things, where the project starts with, "I think that's possible, don't know how to do that, and don't know how long it will take." Other times it feels more like churning out straightforward lines of business logic, implementing patterns discovered in a previous project, or assembling the logic of a database schema into a wireframed MVC app in Rails or, quite possibly, Wordpress.  And, even if my "backend" skills (whatever that means) proves the better career in the long run, not being able to do this is just a big hole in my ability to identify as a DIY problem solver, who sometimes solves problems with no code, sometimes with a lot of code, and much of the time in between.
