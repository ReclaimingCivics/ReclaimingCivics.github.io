Songza is the best. These are the best playlists.

# Best thematic playlists

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/spine-tingling-piano-serenades-songza/" target="_blank">Spine Tingling Piano Serenades</a>

The absolute best. Every song has a purpose. Many songs in here really woke up when you think of them as a serenade Sia's "Breathe Me" I thought I was over, until I heard this playlist. Which shows you how much a playlist can add to a song.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/mystical-indie-muses-songza/" target="blank">Mystical Indie Muses</a>

This is a surprisingly diverse playlist. The thing the songs have in common is they're all very strong - musically, lyrically, you name it.

# Pretty good playlists

#### <a href="http://songza.com/user/playlists/favorites/" target="blank">Freshly Squeezed</a>

Pretty good electronica leaning but a really good mix! I got this song "Big Light" by Houses from it and I feel the rest of the playlist is about leading up to this one really song. The lyrics are lyrical and the song fits.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/the-walk-songza/" target="blank">The Walk</a>

Indie/electronica for when you're on an urban walk. Chillout music but not draining and pretty diverse.

# Explicitly night-time playlists

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/gentle-bedroom-rock-songza/" target="blank">(Gentle) Bedroom Rock</a>

Was renamed for some reason. Very thematic. Very impressive as a playlist. Very draining to still have on in the morning.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/bedroom-chillout-songza/" target="blank">Bedroom Chillout</a>

A more intense version of Bedroom Rock. Still draining in the morning and harder to fall asleep to.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/dream-pop-songza/" target="blank">Dream Pop</a>

Pretty easy-listening and really enjoyable. Acceptable to fall asleep to and wake up on.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/dream-pop-deep-sleep-songza/" target="blank">Dream Pop Deep Sleep</a>

Less acceptable to wake up on.

# Seasonal Playlists that are Actually Good

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/cool-new-music-fall-2012-songza/" target="blank">Fall 2012</a>

It's saved to my favorites, apparently I really liked it.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/user/playlists/favorites/" target="blank">Winter 2013</a>

This was a really big hit in my life back in 2013. The band Hey Ocean! is introduced, which put out a really good bright pop album.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/user/playlists/favorites/"?Summer 2013</a>

I guess I liked this one. I don't really know what's on it.

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/before-it-breaks-spring-2014-bempology/" target="blank">Before it Breaks: Spring 2014</a>

This was a seriously great playlist! It became my running music for the very beautiful spring and summer of 2014, in which I became a runner.

# Crowd Pleasers

#### <a href="http://songza.com/listen/90s-crowd-pleasing-hits-songza/" target="blank">90s</a>

This was a big board game night hit.
