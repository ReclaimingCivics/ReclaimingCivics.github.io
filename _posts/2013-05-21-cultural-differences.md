title: Some cultural differences between the Midwest and New York

Was unsure the proper way to generalize. Really I'm just talking about my own experiences growing up in semi-rural Michigan and living in New York, but going with "the Midwest" and "New York," and if these are too narrow or too broad, so be it.

This post does have a more specific point though. I'm kind of interested in why New York is more stressful, and why it's hard for me to go back and enjoy "the simple things" in quite the same way.

* Proper attire in the Midwest is that in which you are prepared to do most things. There are things you dress up nice for, but otherwise you are probably wearing something like tennis shoes, jeans, and a sweatshirt. Chances are you have an outdoor chore to do. If you go to a party or barbecue you need to be ready to help with some silly chore that takes a few hands, to cook, to fly a kite, to play baseball, possibly even to get wet via squirt gun.

  In general I was much less healthy in the Midwest but I will say that at least the prospect you might exercise via running around playing as a kid, or playing with kids as an adult, does not require you to have a gym bag on you and shower close by.

* Midwest is more oriented to place than events. "We're going over Grandma's house" is a pretty complete plan. Most family members are actually pretty good at enjoying that trip. This is partly because my Grandma is very lovely at these things.

* You are proud of how good you are at New York. Finding shows, restaurants, being something of a subway whiz; at one end these things are competitions, at the other end a way of life. Because it also includes dating and time management, being able to make a group of people happen to do something, and, see next item.

* In New York everything is indefinitely competitive. I think I learned this when I met a counterexample to this rule, by ordering a whiskey at a Prohibition-style bar - no really, it was an anachronism and had no pretenses about it - and had the bartender refer to it as "the good stuff." This caught me: What do you mean "the good stuff"? There's something profoundly plebeian about the fact that a fixed food or drink or item of clothing or musician or show or bar can be somehow, top notch. That just means you haven't searched enough to find something better.

  Contrast this with Michigan where pretty much anyone can grill a good hot dog or burger, but Dads do it best. It's a much more brand-name oriented culture instead of one where you try to obscure that or get away from it. I think it's important to remember that in Michigan brand-names don't necessarily supply some great pinnacle of human taste or experience - just a simple pleasure and nothing more.

  So this will probably challenge me on next return trip. I don't eat meat and avoid processed foods in general and feel somewhat sorry for people who haven't come to realize you should do this. But on the other hand, I wonder how much heart health I would trade for not worrying about these things. There's the mismatch.

* Climate change and many other world problems are much less scary in the Midwest. An out-of-season tornado is known simply as "crazy weather." Sometimes "Michigan weather," because Michigandiers aren't really used to weather making sense along normal patterns that humans pick up on. Bee colony collapse? It's hard to imagine that stopping the garden from growing. Out of power for a few days? There's probably still enough to do and you can still drive somewhere.

  New York is on a coast. It gets hit by hurricanes (now). It has suffered a major terrorist attack. It has a water supply that is threatened by fracking. Batman villains have a thing against it. Homeless people are always visible. So most world problems you feel more acutely here.
