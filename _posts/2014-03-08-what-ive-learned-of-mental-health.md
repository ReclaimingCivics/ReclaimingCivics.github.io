title: How my view on psychiatric treatment has changed since beginning therapy

I am receiving treatment both for bipolar disorder (BPD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). I feel very strongly about liberal acceptance of mental health and have teetered on how open to be regarding my illnesses. The truth is I want to be very open, but that doesn't mean I want to discuss this with everyone, and that is okay. Such is the irony of ultra-connected life: everything is public, and then we can choose to be private.

I have received treatment both via psychiatric medications and sessions with a therapist. I feel both are necessary. There are aspects of my illnesses that are extremely responsive to medication and aspects that are surprisingly responsive to talk therapy. This lets me grow.

I'll try to describe what it's like to take a psychiatric drug that works. Imagine taking cocaine or ecstasy or some happy (harmful or not) drug, except you become more sober. You become more functional, more grounded, more connected, and relationships with other people suddenly become sober and present. Anyway, one day it hit me that this is what mentally healthy people feel like all the time, and that inspired me to write this piece.

## I've realized that "to anti-depressant or not to anti-depressant?" is a wrong and broken question

I had one conversation where I urged a friend into a psychiatrist's care because she seemed to have a depression pattern. We went back and forth for a while and the discussion floated around "Will the psychiatrist give me an anti-depressant or not?"

The psychiatrist did give her an anti-depressant, but advised her to take it only when she was on her period. This was somehow obvious in retrospect but neither of us had any idea this was a thing. But the doctor, of course, did. An anti-depressant can be used topically, instead of somehow as a matter of permanent identity. Yet, this is not what people think of when they think of anti-depressants. They think of an anti-depressant as more permanent and denigrating to their character.

Depressions are really complex and diverse, and so are psychiatric treatments. I will return to this theme again: things that people don't know are problems, are, in fact, treatable. Yet a person must see a mental health professional to even start this conversation.

## It's not clear whether "I am" or "I have"

In fact, a lot of my emotional growth has had to do with saying less "well I have OCD so I have this problem" (I do) and more to do with "well sometimes I get a bit obsessive, so I try to deal with it this way." You can maybe imagine how the "I get obsessive" mindset is a lot less obsessive. I'm describing how OCD affects me, not getting stuck on the fact that I have it.

This lines up with important identity questions. When I'm trying to work through and treat my disorder - and OCD is a disorder that can be worked through - I prefer "I have," partly for its therapeutic effect, and if I'm partaking in this effect I am practicing working through this idea and feeling what it's like to actually believe it. When I'm discussing aspects of my disorder that are rigid and I feel I have little control over, I say "I am."

This is a little depressing, but I think it's very important to acknowledge the cold reality: I am bipolar. Medication is not an option. I am hurting myself tremendously to believe this can change like an infection can be cured. This cannot be understated. So, I *am* bipolar, treated or not.

## Sometimes medication is not an option, by a long shot

I am not a psychiatrist and for what follows I assume there are exceptions. But if you are also not a psychiatrist, then listen up. Bipolar disorder is treatable by mood stabilizier and mood stabilizer only. Any story you've heard about someone who was "cured" of bipolar disorder through any other treatment has the following properties.

### It is scientifically false

There are two main ways this can be false. The first is the fact that bipolar disorder is incredibly easy to misdiagnose either as a false positive or false negative. Yes, this is, partly, a problem with our mental health system, and partly because this is a challenging pattern to diagnose. The second, even more insidious way is that the person is now an untreated bipolar person. To remind the reader, about 50% of untreated bipolar people make a suicide attempt at some point in their life, and about 25% die from suicide. If you know such a person, get them help, now.

### It spreads like an urban legend

Two, stories like this spread like urban legend because people absolutely love stories where the human condition wins over the chemical. As a human who needs psychochemical intervention to stay alive, I dissent.

## I've realized most people should be taking a psychiatric medication of some sort

Instead, we still see it as noble to never need a medication.

Often the question is asked, "would you see a doctor if you got the flu?" I think this is still too trite. I think cancer is a better analogy. People admit they have the flu, but they do not always admit they have symptoms of cancer. If you are young and healthy, you may not realize this. You think if you have a symptom of cancer, you immediately see a doctor and get a clear diagnosis. But people actually avoid this in conniving ways, because it is terrifying, and also because they believe life can proceed normally a bit longer before the gruesome phase of realization and treatment begins.

It is not clear whether the realization of major illness, or treatment of major illness, is worse.

I think this is a better analogy. There is nothing noble about avoiding discussion of a psychology condition with a psychologist or psychiatrist, especially if it is a serious condition. There is similarly nothing noble about refusing or ignoring treatment in favor of non-scientific treatment, and in fact, I know we believe this, because I remember when Steve Jobs died of liver cancer, allegedly, for this very reason.


### There's a lot of minor ailments people have no idea about

Actually, I think considering *minor* ailments opens up the mind about what psychiatric treatment is and what it is supposed to do. A very simple diagnosis might be a vitamin D deficiency. This causes immunodeficiency and depression, among other things. Many people would be happy to discover *not* that "their depression" is caused by a vitamin deficiency, but that *how they feel anyway* is *depressed and naturally treatable.* People find it more natural to frame how they feel in terms of depression when it's not, you know, Depression, or when it's not out of their hands to treat.

If you are an athlete you get a yearly physical and have to, even frequently, see a sports medicine doctor or physical therapist. If you're a knowledge worker, or more simply, a *goddamn human being*, maybe you should see a therapist once a year for a "psychical." Maybe you have a problem that you didn't even know you could treat.

Yet it's noble to never even have this consultation.

### We would stop romanticizing the past

Nearly everyone needs psychiatric treatment. Whether it's to have a disorder diagnosed and treatment begun or a vitamin deficiency spotted, people should be having this conversation with their doctor.

Yet we always compare it to the "good old days" when we didn't have anti-depressants. But, we did have depression. People didn't necessarily live that long either, and they weren't necessariliy happy. In fact, I would much rather live today where should I have the luck of being born with bipolar disorder, there exists treatments, because bipolar disorder is often fatal.

## Emotional health is part of mental health

How much struggle do you need with your teammates or manager or romantic partner before you might have room to benefit from therapy?

Here is the answer:

1. you have to be functioning sufficiently poorly
2. so that those who believe in your decency as a human being can no longer fathom that "this" is your fault
3. then they will immediately act like "it" is your fault
4. as they urge you to admit you're enough of a failure to see a therapist
5. because somehow seeing a therapist had a lot to do with your performance as a human being in the first place!

I believe this is wrong.

I have had struggles in my relationships with others. This is a very thing to say and it is very true generally. These struggles have been very receptive to talk therapy, but I will add, only after my bipolar disorder was diagnosed and treated. I am grateful I did not spend several more years struggling in relationships before beginning treatement.

## Public health facts would be facts

Public health scientists and officials are sort of crippled by the fact that they're only allowed to blame things like childhood trauma *so much*. In fact, they want to blame "mommy and daddy issues" for nearly every public health problem facing America today. But they can't, because that's too creepy. Facts don't get to be facts.
