Title: What I think it means to study complex adaptive systems
layout: post-index

I read Page's book *Complex Adaptive Systems*, and got a much sharper sense of what it means to study this topic. In saying I want to study CAS, I am saying one of the following:

* I want to study computational theory, which is useful in all sciences, but means I will basically become a scientist or researcher of some sort
* I want to solve specific problems in the social sciences, environmental sciences, or some other field where CAS is a hot technique
* I want to specialize in a hard science like physics, and learn things like chaos theory and statistical mechanics
* I think programming with automata is really fun
* I want to study artificial intelligence and am anticipating pure, theoretical study of cellular automata being of pivotal importance

The study of AI is my main motivation, but it's important to say that programming with cellular automata just sounds fun. That's a big motivator.

I knew complex adaptive systems sounds interesting and relevant, and have spent the past several weeks turning my hunch into a plan. Miller and Page's book was instrumental to me. My biggest takeaway was in thinking of how an area science is varyingly defined by problems pursued and techniques used:  

  * Mathematics is the study of things that can be learned by rigorous deduction. It is defined by a tool. Areas of math, such as algebraic geometry or differential equations, are motivated by problems they are trying to solve, even if these problems were borne only by trying to rigorously deduce things.
  * Philosophy is the science that tries to translate problems from discourse and thought experiment to rigorous deduction and other scientific techniques. It's quite beautiful to think of philosophy this way.
  * Economics has a complex history. Adam Smith's *The Invisible Hand* is a key work, and is purely discursive. In the last few decades the mathematicians took over, and now rigorous deduction is the only accepted technique. This is controversial.
  * Social sciences require experimental evidence. It's very odd for a mathematician to read a social science paper that uses rigorous deduction, since it will still contain evidence. This is actually good science: inductive evidence corroborates that the rigorous model was well-applied and void of errors.

 Therefore, I questioned whether complex systems is a technique or a theory. My current understanding that to think of it as a theory involves thinking of it as a maturing technique within artificial intelligence. This is good direction for now.
