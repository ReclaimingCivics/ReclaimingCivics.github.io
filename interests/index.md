#### Agricola

This is good for the analytical crowd, but it's independent enough that personalities don't clash, and people tend to enjoy watching their farm come to tenure. The problem is the newbie's first game always goes terribly and there's little way to recover from it.

#### Puerto Rico

Very strategy-based. It's a really hard game. Lots of rules, takes about 45 minutes to explain. I recommend this pretty much for the strategy crowd.

#### Pandemic

The best co-op game.

#### Ticket to Ride Light rule-wise and officially a family game.

#### Settlers of Catan

I will never play Settlers again. Don't make me.
