title: Why I'm Vegan

I am asked this a lot and it is something that is important to me and I believe in, so I want to answer this up front and as publicly as possible. Let's start with a list.

### The exceptions first

I eat fish that is certified by Monterey Bay Aquarium. I eat eggs or dairy if I trust the farmers market, although I do not know my exact guielines. I eat processed foods whose main ingredients are vegan (but may contain traces). **The exception proves the rule.** My vegan ethic would be incomplete without these exceptions, because they show the difference between what I practice and something -- well, something else.

### It's kind of healthy

It's not a perfect diet health-wise, but it is a good diet. Veganism limits (but does not halt) access to processed foods. This is a good thing. It also balances one's diet because the fresh veggies really shine on the plate. I can also follow the diet because of my overall total commitment.

### We shouldn't be having a debate about animal treatment in the first place

Butchering an animal? Totally fine in my opinion. It has to die somehow and part of my vegan ethic is embracing our place in the food chain.

How we actually treat animals? It looks like the gravest torture of long time spent in prison. It's flat wrong that arguing in favor of animal rights seems fringe. We're just arguing that one who eats animals should want the animal to be treated in a manner vaguely consistent with how she or he already believes the animal should be treated.

I am in favor of knowledge influencing actions. Scary, right? If when you learn what you're eating, you're grossed out, it's a pretty strong signal to me.

### It's the only easy win

Pretty much every world problem is impacted by meat overconsumption. Most notably, carbon levels. You can lop off something like 90% of your food-based carbon emissions by quitting meat. It's the only ten-dollar bill lying on the ground here.

### No one has called me out

The only weak part in my argument could be that I'm basically regurgating *The Omnivore's Dilemma,* a book that is probably right but could be wrong. Yet no one I talk to on this digs down, because the only people who are knowledgeable enough to probably agree with the conclusions anyway. Objections always focus on "isn't it hard?" and how weird it is to care this much, but again, factory meat was never supposed to be normal.

### Staying connected

I believe an ethic that is not connected to society is useless. I do not want to live off the fruit of the land. I want to live in the city, where my actions can impact people and impact and move society. Ethics is nothing without connections to others, so what's the point in living alone? And, I have big, emotional goals in life, to have a career and relationship, that I can't wish away. So connection is a must.

That's why I occasionally slip up on cheese. I really do believe in my diet and don't see any reason to fake condonement of factory meat eating. I also don't think anything is to be gained from being impossible to be around. But I make a point of not finding a conflict here.

### I appreciate food more

I know what's in things, know how to cook things, and pay lots of attention at restaurants since I need to know who has vegan options. I try more diverse foods since, say, a cupcake place might not carry a chocolate-vanilla vegan cupcake, but might carry a carrot cake one. I know where lots of good restaurants are now. There's less choice paralysis since the great vegan places are pretty well-loved and raved and have devotees. If you'll pardon the term, vegans make good foodies. They certainly care about food.

### Subsidies are out of control

Just pay the true cost of meat and half the battle is won.

### Meat always was supposed to be a luxury

So terrible that what makes us fat was supposed to be never taken for granted. I think that true enjoyment of meat comes from how difficult it is to acquire. Treat it well, eat occasionally. Hunt it, gut it and clean it, for instance.

### Am I really a vegan?

Is there a vegan police chasing me for eating fish and calling myself a vegan? If someone wants to discuss the nuances of this with me, believe me, I am more than happy to.

I need the label because people do respect it as a dietary line that won't be crossed. And when I cross it I go into why, and usually am respected for how my exceptions are strict and values-driven.

There's not a better label currently for "conscientious according to self-defined values near-vegan." I am on a values-driven restriction-based diet. Uh, I guess. I'm just saying vegan if 5 letters is necessary.

Also boo monoculture.
