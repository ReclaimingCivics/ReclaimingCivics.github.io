### A little introduction

I am a New York-based software developer with a background in math. Most influential books to me have been *Godel Escher Bach* and *I Am A Strange Loop,* so if you are familiar with those, you will know quite a bit about where I am coming from.

Right now, this site exists largely so that I can practice writing and writing openly. Up there under categories on the right, you may find some more or less presentable pieces of interest, but I am not quite ready to "showcase" the work here.

[This piece by Ezra Klein]((http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/20/what-romney-doesnt-understand-about-personal-responsibility/)), written in the wake of Mitt Romney's 47% remark (we totally remember that guy, right?) was very inspirational to me. It ties in very nicely with both my personal interests and my professional one: how can I become aware of my own mental resources, and how can I practice empathy for the resources of others?  This is a budding career interest. I want to make people happen, and I feel the importance of this will become only more relevant in the face of challenges our society will be facing going forward.
