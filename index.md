## Fiction

### The Art of Racing in the Rain a.k.a. The Dog Book

> These jobs almost always took place in California, or sometimes in Nevada or Texas, and occasionally in Connecticut, and therefore were forbidden to him. He was a prisoner of the state.
  And yet.
  We are all afforded our physical existence so we can learn about ourselves. So I understand why Denny, on a deeper level, allowed this situation to befall him. I wonâ€™t say he created the situation, but he allowed it. Because he needed to test his mettle. He wanted to know how long he could keep his foot on the accelerator before lifting.

This was profound and is a big part of how I've gone deeper in my career and studies.

### I Am a Strange Loop

Superintelligence may happen in our lifetime. The imaginative science fiction writers who create both dystopias and utopias are giving way to truly terrified pessimists. Besides predicting the future, it's important to imagine it in a way that does something for us in the present moment, and that's where this book comes in.
