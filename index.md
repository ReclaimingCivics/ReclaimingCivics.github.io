### A little introduction

I am a New York-based startup technologist. I try to have a wide range of interests, but naturally, some things emerge:

* I maintain a vegan diet, although if I manage to shoot a deer on my forthcoming (and first) hunting trip, that can be the exception that proves the rule.
* Too many lifehacks and you will need to liferefactor. I practice meditation regularly and 
* I care very deeply about cognition and well-being. [This piece by Ezra Klein](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/20/what-romney-doesnt-understand-about-personal-responsibility/) is a succinct introduction to both recognizing the concept of cognitive bandwidth, and using creative analytic skills to develop empathy for those in different walks of life.
* My background is in mathematics, and I think that mentality will always be ticking within me. Thus far my programming career has been in C/C++ and web technologies, but I love statistical thinking and look for chances to invest in that direction.
* This site contains an algamation of my writings. Right now, I'm focusing on getting my stream-of-consciousness to hit the paper. I certainly have not found my voice, nor have I found central themes in what I write about. So, read at your own risk :)

### Contact me if...

* Pictures of corgis are always welcome.
* You want to learn more about anything I've posted about here.
* I am for the most part not interested in job offers or recruitment and plan to see things through with my current start-up. However, if you can help me with these questions:
    - I really like inspiring people, how do I turn that into a serious career velocity from my technology background?
    - What are good next steps to take in me becoming a stronger math/data person, without turning away from the technology skill set?
    - How do I find good public service-oriented business opportunities?
    
    Then I am all ears.
