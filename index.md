{% include JB/setup %}

I am a New York-based mathematically inclined software developer.  This is my personal page, which will include links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackExchange profiles, as well as blog posts.  Blog posts I will probably broadly divide into "general" and "technical" categories.  The former category will include more personal observations as well as more politics-posts; in any case, they are opinions I have and would like to make public.  The latter is more to make sure that as I learn things either at work or on my own time, the knowledge learned exists somewhere.

Here I need to add:

* LinkedIn
* github
* StackOverflow
* RSS to blog posts
* SE Careers profile
* Posts should appear on front page
