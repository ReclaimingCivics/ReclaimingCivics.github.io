### A little introduction

I am a New York-based software developer with a background in math. Most influential books to me have been *Godel Escher Bach* and *I Am A Strange Loop,* so if you are familiar with those, you will know quite a bit about where I am coming from.

Right now, this site exists largely so that I can practice writing and writing openly.

* [This piece](/technology/2013/05/28/mindfulness-programming/) will give you an idea of what interests me in technology and programming.
* [Here is a novice attempt](/general/2013/06/16/pocketsmith/) at technology writing. A lot of my day job is figuring out what makes a good UX, so I take the time to write about my experiences with other products to practice and share this some.
* [This piece by Ezra Klein](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/20/what-romney-doesnt-understand-about-personal-responsibility/), written in the wake of Mitt Romney's 47% remark (we totally remember that guy, right?) was very inspirational to me. It ties in very nicely with both my personal interests and my professional one: how can I become aware of my own mental resources, and how can I practice empathy for the resources of others?  This is a budding career interest. I want to make people happen, and I feel the importance of this will become only more relevant in the face of challenges our society will be facing going forward.

### Contact me if...

* Pictures of corgis are always welcome.
* You want to learn more about anything I've posted about here.
* I am for the most part not interested in job offers or recruitment and plan to see things through with my current start-up. However, if you can help me with these questions:
    - I really like inspiring people, how do I turn that into a serious career velocity from my technology background?
    - What are good next steps to take in me becoming a stronger math/data person, without turning away from the technology skill set?
    - How do I find good public service-oriented business opportunities?
    
    Then I am all ears.
