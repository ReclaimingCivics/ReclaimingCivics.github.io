# Mission 

Reclaiming Civics focuses on building the dialogue skills, primarily in progressives, in people who feel that political discourse as we have been engaging in it has failed. It has failed at effecting change, failed at communication, and failed at keeping our ties and relationships together as a society.

Reclaiming Civics is the humble assertion that there is a better way. We will use the tools of creating a safe dialog where ideas are shared between parties, even those with very opposing viewpoints. In this project you will be invited to reach across the aisle until you are uncomfortable but before you feel fear.

Strategically, crucial dialogue skills may most affect regions that marginally voted for the man who did not win the popular vote. Making political dialogue safe (again?) is a worthwhile goal in its own right. Converting red to blue districts is a very worthwhile goal as well.


# Principles of Respectful, Effective Dialog

1. **Nobody ever wins an argument, because nobody will ever lose an argument.** If your goal is shoveling your viewpoint across, you are doing it wrong. But if you think, “there must be a better way,” you have come to the right place!
2. **People will only earnestly dialogue if they feel safe.** If your conversation partner senses they may be wrong, you have the greatest duty to let them experience this safely with your kind support. If your conversation partner expresses their idea, you have the duty of defeating their expectation that you will retaliate in attack.
3. **Invent mutual purpose.** There is a mosaic of common purposes between any two parties in dialogue: a healthy family, the chance to safely share ideas with someone who disagrees, pursuing economic growth, healing specific geographic or racial chasms that are open in society, trying to learn something new, the joy of testing an idea without becoming angry. Always bring your dialogue back to the mutual purpose you are trying to develop.
4. **Listening is not compromising.** You will learn something about your opposing partner’s view. This can be uncomfortable if you find their view repulsive. Understanding anything and everything about why they hold that viewpoint does not offend the views you hold yourself.
5. **Finding middle ground is the wrong goal.** Rather than learn to compromise toward viewpoints you vehemently disagree with, you will hold yourself to maintain respect and learn the skill of agreeing to disagree. Your door will stay open the next time the next time your conversation partner  needs to discuss their views, and that is an accomplishment.
6. **If you use facts to hurt people, you share the blame when they reject them.** Facts can sting. Facts can be humiliating. Facts can make someone rethink who they trust. Sometimes it is safer to deny them, if the person presenting them is vicious. Do not be vicious.
7.  **Difficult ideas are effectively communicated in small victories, not large ones.** No one will convert to your side overnight. But maybe they will leave their conversation with you feeling a little curious about something you said, or a little apologetic for a mistaken belief they may realize they have held, or a little terrified news sources or politicians they followed have misled or hurt them. Small victories count.
8. **It is safe to make a mistake.** It is always better to leave the door open, especially across the political aisle, than closed. You are strong enough to make a mistake and learn from it.
9. **Progressives stand the most to gain from these techniques, but conservatives are enthusiastically welcome here.** This sub was created in response to the mistakes uniquely made by progressives leading up to the 2016 election season. Nonetheless, we openly welcome anyone coming from a conservative viewpoint who wants to improve their dialogue skills in civics.
