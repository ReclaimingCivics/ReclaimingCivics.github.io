#### Everything on this site

has in common that you either learn something about me, or you learn something about you. I strive for both. I try not to post things that are knowledge in a vacuum. I'd rather think about how it might affect you. So, that is the guiding principle here, and I hope you find something you enjoy.

# Books

## Fiction

#### The Art of Racing in the Rain a.k.a. The Dog Book

This is a magical book on having and expressing feelings without speaking or analyzing. Recommended for geeks and romantics.

#### Snow Falling on Cedars

"He was happy, happier than he had been before, and yet a part of him ached knowing that this was happening in just this way, and would never again happen this way for as long as he lived."

#### Anna Karenina

It's a big book, and I just think it's worth it to make sure you don't spoil yourself with easy-to-ccomplish books. Tolstoy's omniscient voice is special. It's perspective you don't always realize one could even have on interactions and relationships.

#### Norwegian Wood

Murakami has mostly won me over. This book struck me hard with a lesson on empathy. Maybe we treat people we know who struggle in ways we don't understand like characters in a magical realist novel.

#### The Unbearable Lightness of Being

This one has a title that speaks for itself. I like that the book is light, and I like that the darkness and tragedy of the novel doesn't detract from its lessons on beauty.

## General Reading Non-Fiction

#### The Little Guide to Your Well Read Life

It's a short, heavy book, and a great exercise in what things you didn't know you were worrying about and didn't have to. It's pretty and just a worthy part of a reading collection.

#### The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America

A history book that teaches that history is about finding things that had a history at all. It was very important for me understanding where the American obsession with yoga and "the Orient" in general seams with yoga actually practiced in India. And, for the record, made me pretty proud to do so.

#### Sustainable Sushi

This is just a book given to me as a gift by the sushi-ya at Mashiko in Seattle. It's a reminder to me of how passionate someone can be about his or her own little corner of the world.

#### Eat Pray Love

It's a good book. The "eat" part is about resuscitating oneself from emaciating depression. The "pray" part is showing what mid-life growth looks like when it hasn't happened in ages. And "love" is about showing the growth sticks. It's a pity so many people dismiss this one, so I felt compelled to describe it.

#### The Omnivore's Dilemma

I can't honestly say I've educated myself much on our food system since reading this book. I did, however, go vegan. So I don't have to worry about factory farms or any (most) of that stuff anymore.

#### The Classical Style

This is a music history and theory book that finally taught me what I've wanted to know about how music history and theory relate. It also shows the principle that you shouldn't always think about what you're interested in, but simply read the best books in the fields that happen to have amazing books that will teach you about *everything*.

#### Manage Your Day-to-Day

A short self-help book that reads between a reference and a manual. It's really helpful to flip through every few weeks just as a reminder, which I think sets it apart from many self-help or productivity tomes.

#### Godel, Escher, Bach

This book inspired me greatly in as many fields as the title would suggest. Most importantly, it made both classical music, and computer science relevant to the life I live and actually want to live.

#### I Am a Strange Loop

This is serious philosophy that ultimately argues that love makes us sentient. You won't be afraid to practice meditation or work on empathy for others just because the future is coming.

#### The Death and Life of Great American Cities

This book taught me the logic of New York. It makes city streets come to life, and makes news articles on issues like gentrification and how tall or short the mayor is make sense.

#### Nine out of Every Ten Climber Make the Same Mistakes

This book taught me to think of myself as an athlete, and I love how much direct wisdom came from an ostensible technical training book.

# Articles

These are some of the best articles I've read.

#### [Aeon Magazine: Humanity's Deep Future](http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/ross-andersen-human-extinction/)

This article shows Aeon magazine at its best and its worst. It is deeply imaginative while being extremely believable: about the future but still relevant. Unfortunately I believe it also shows that intellectual connections are cheap, and Aeon is full of them. Read at your own pleasure

#### [Ezra Klein: What Romney Doesn't Get About Responsibility](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-09-18/what-mitt-romney-doesn-t-get-about-responsibility)

An amazing introduction to the struggle of the poor and how cognitive bandwidth matters. I love how timeeless a piece in the heat of an election campaign turned out to be.

#### [Why Developing Serious Relationships In Your Twenties Matters](https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/why-developing-serious-relationships-in-your-20s-matters-cff4161f551c)

A beautiful thing about how tragic life is and how building relationships is tantamount to enduring it with grace.

#### [Douglas Hofstadter: A Person Paper on the Purity of Language](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html)

Definitive proof of the power of showing over telling.
